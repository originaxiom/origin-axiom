# Phase 3 NON-CLAIMS

Phase 3 does **not** claim:

1. That the Origin Axiom is proven as a law of nature.
2. That θ is *the* unique unifying phase of the Standard Model.
3. That a golden-ratio / φ narrative is required or fundamental.
4. That the framework solves Λ or predicts observable deviations beyond current constraints.
5. That baryogenesis or dark matter are explained (they remain future work / separate phases).

Phase 3 claims are strictly limited to:
- Fit reproducibility for θ under the stated ansatz/model class,
- Consistent parameter injection into the vacuum-residue mechanism,
- Documented correlations and falsifiability statements.
