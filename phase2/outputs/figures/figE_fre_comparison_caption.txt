Figure E. Cosmological response to the Origin-Axiom vacuum energy residual in a flat FRW universe.
Shown are the scale factor a(\tau) (top), normalized Hubble rate H/H_0 (middle), and deceleration parameter q(\tau) (bottom) as functions of dimensionless time \tau = H_0 t. Three cases are compared: a matter-only universe (\Omega_\Lambda=0), standard ΛCDM with observed vacuum energy (\Omega_{\Lambda,\mathrm{obs}}=0.7), and a universe in which the Origin-Axiom residual vacuum energy is interpreted as an effective cosmological constant (\Omega_{\Lambda,\mathrm{eff}}). The Origin-Axiom curve exhibits the same qualitative late-time behavior as ΛCDM—accelerated expansion driven by a positive vacuum component—while differing only in magnitude. No modification of the Einstein equations is assumed; the residual enters solely as an effective vacuum energy density. All quantities are computed self-consistently from the Phase 2 mode-sum model, with explicit mapping from the dimensionless residual to \Omega_{\Lambda,\mathrm{eff}} declared in the configuration.
