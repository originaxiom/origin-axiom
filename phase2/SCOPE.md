# Origin Axiom — Phase 2  
## Scope Definition

This document defines the **explicit scope, objectives, and exclusions** of Phase 2 of the
Origin Axiom project. It is binding for all code, figures, and claims in this phase.

Phase 2 must be readable and defensible as a **standalone scientific contribution**.

---

## Purpose of Phase 2

The purpose of Phase 2 is to determine whether the global non-cancellation axiom introduced
in Phase 1 can give rise to a **small, positive vacuum energy residual** in a setting that
approximates quantum field theory, and whether such a residual is **cosmologically viable**
when inserted into standard Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) cosmology.

Phase 2 focuses on:
- quantitative behavior,
- robustness under parameter variation,
- and consistency with late-time cosmic acceleration.

---

## Core Questions Addressed

Phase 2 addresses the following questions:

1. Does the Origin Axiom generically prevent exact cancellation of vacuum energy
   in a QFT-inspired mode-sum model?
2. Is the resulting residual stable under variation of:
   - the global non-cancellation floor ε,
   - ultraviolet cutoff scale,
   - number of contributing modes?
3. When interpreted as an effective vacuum energy density, does the residual produce
   Λ-like late-time acceleration in a flat FRW universe?

Only these questions are within scope.

## What Phase 2 Explicitly Claims

Phase 2 may claim:

- The **existence** of a non-zero vacuum energy residual enforced by the Origin Axiom.
- The **robustness** of this residual under controlled parameter variations.
- The **cosmological viability** of the residual when interpreted as an effective
  cosmological constant in standard FRW dynamics.
- That a universe governed by the Origin Axiom can naturally exhibit
  late-time accelerated expansion.

All claims must be supported by reproducible numerical artifacts.

## What Phase 2 Explicitly Does NOT Claim

Phase 2 does NOT:

- identify the microscopic or fundamental origin of the interference phase,
- derive the value of ε from first principles,
- claim an exact numerical match to the observed cosmological constant,
- modify Einstein’s equations or introduce alternative gravity theories,
- establish a solution to the cosmological constant problem in a definitive sense,
- connect the mechanism to Standard Model, flavor, or neutrino physics,
- propose unification between vacuum energy and other sectors.

Any such claims are strictly deferred to later phases.

## Relationship to Phase 1

Phase 1 established the **Origin Axiom** as a global non-cancellation principle and
demonstrated its existence and scaling behavior in simplified settings.

Phase 2:
- **inherits** the axiom as an interface,
- does **not** reinterpret, modify, or strengthen it,
- does **not** rely on Phase 1 code or outputs at runtime.

Phase 1 remains conceptually and numerically frozen.

---

## Relationship to Future Phases

Phase 2 does not assume or require:

- a specific physical source of the interference phase,
- links to flavor mixing, CP violation, or particle physics,
- inflationary dynamics or early-universe phase transitions,
- quantum gravity or holographic frameworks.

Such topics may be explored in later phases but are **out of scope here**.

---

## Methodological Boundaries

Within Phase 2:

- All parameters are treated as **model inputs**, not derived constants.
- Numerical experiments are designed to test **existence and robustness**, not fine-tuning.
- Cosmological interpretation is performed using **standard FRW equations** with no
  modification beyond the inclusion of an effective vacuum energy density.
- The analysis remains global in character; locality and microcausality are not addressed.

---

## Summary

Phase 2 is a **quantitative and cosmological discipline phase**.

It establishes that, assuming the Origin Axiom, a small positive vacuum energy residual
can emerge robustly and behave as an effective cosmological constant at late times,
without committing to deeper theoretical origins or unification.

This limited but well-defined scope is intentional and necessary for scientific rigor.
