We present Phase~II of the Origin Axiom program as a bounded, reproducible test of a single operational hypothesis: imposing a strict global \emph{non-cancellation floor} on a vacuum-like numerical system induces an auditable residual, and that residual can be carried through a minimal end-to-end pipeline without numerical pathology.
The axiom is implemented as a hard inequality constraint on a global complex diagnostic amplitude $A(t)$,
\begin{equation}
|A(t)| \ge \varepsilon \,, \qquad \varepsilon>0 \text{ fixed,}
\end{equation}
enforced at each integration step by a spatially uniform correction that modifies only the zero mode when a trial update would violate the floor.
No microscopic derivation from a local action is assumed; Phase~II evaluates the behavior of this specified constrained implementation under controlled numerical variation.

The manuscript is organized around three explicitly bounded claims with corresponding evidence.
(C2.1) \emph{Existence under constraint:} in a lattice-field testbed, enforcing $|A(t)|\ge\varepsilon$ yields a stable nonzero residual diagnostic relative to an unconstrained baseline (Fig.~\ref{fig:mode_sum_residual}).
(C2.2) \emph{Robustness under controls:} across systematic sweeps in $\varepsilon$ and discretization/UV-control parameters, the induced residual remains well-behaved and exhibits smooth, non-explosive dependence over the explored ranges (Figs.~\ref{fig:scaling_epsilon}--\ref{fig:scaling_modes}).
(C2.3) \emph{FRW consistency:} under a transparent, fixed mapping from the residual diagnostic to an effective constant-term contribution in a toy Friedmann--Robertson--Walker integrator, the resulting trajectories show modest, smooth deviations without instability, serving as an end-to-end consistency check rather than a cosmological prediction (Fig.~\ref{fig:frw_comparison}).

A single phase parameter $\theta$ is treated as an external control input (with an optional anchored value $\theta^\star$ for a fiducial run) and is propagated through the modules to test pipeline coherence under a common phase dependence.
Within the explored regime, the residual diagnostics exhibit order-percent modulation with $\theta$, and the FRW response remains comparably small and smooth.

All figures correspond to tagged runs with recorded configurations, run identifiers, and an appendix run manifest enabling independent regeneration and auditing.
\emph{Scope is explicit:} Phase~II does not claim a first-principles origin of the constraint, does not establish a continuum-limit theorem, and does not claim quantitative agreement with the observed cosmological constant.
