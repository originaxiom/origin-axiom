# Origin Axiom — Phase 2

Phase 2 is the **vacuum → cosmology bridge** phase of the Origin Axiom project.

It is intentionally narrow, reproducible, and claim-disciplined.

See:

- `SCOPE.md` — what Phase 2 is allowed to do
- `CLAIMS.md` — the only claims Phase 2 makes (and their artifact backing)
- `ASSUMPTIONS.md` — what is assumed (and only what is assumed)
- `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` — provenance rules and what “locked” means

## What Phase 2 produces

Phase 2 produces exactly five canonical figures (A–E), generated by Snakemake:

- `outputs/figures/figA_mode_sum_residual.pdf`
- `outputs/figures/figB_scaling_epsilon.pdf`
- `outputs/figures/figC_scaling_cutoff.pdf`
- `outputs/figures/figD_scaling_modes.pdf`
- `outputs/figures/figE_frw_comparison.pdf`

Each figure has a corresponding run pointer file:

- `outputs/figures/<figure>.run_id.txt`

which points to a provenance-complete run directory:

- `outputs/runs/<run_id>/`

## Canonical build

From the Phase 2 root:

```bash
snakemake -c 1 all
