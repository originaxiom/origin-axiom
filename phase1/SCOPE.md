# Phase 1 Scope (Non-negotiable)

Phase 1 goal: establish the minimal, θ*-agnostic Origin Axiom core and a proof-of-concept
demonstration that perfect cancellation is structurally forbidden (|A| > ε), yielding a
stable non-zero residual amplitude baseline.

Included in Phase 1:
- Axiom: |A| > ε as a global non-cancellation constraint (θ*-agnostic)
- Minimal toy interference model(s): phasor sums / finite-dimensional analogues
- Minimal lattice demonstration (only as an existence proof): constrained vs unconstrained
- Scaling check: residual vs system size / number of modes

Explicitly excluded from Phase 1:
- Any use of θ* extracted from flavor fits
- Any use of φ or φ^φ as a “selected” value or motivation
- Flavor phenomenology, CKM/PMNS fits, theta-star repo integration
- Claims of solving the cosmological constant problem definitively
- Claims of unification, SM completion, quantum gravity completion

Phase 1 deliverable:
- 10–20 page paper focusing on (i) axiom formalization, (ii) minimal toy support,
  (iii) numerical proof-of-concept, (iv) limitations, (v) Phase 2 compatibility notes.
