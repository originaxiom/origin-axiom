# Phase 1 — Explicit Assumptions

This document enumerates all assumptions underlying Phase 1 of the
Origin Axiom project.

No assumption is implicit.
No assumption is hidden.
No assumption is claimed to be derived.

## 1. Foundational Assumptions (Axiomatic)

**A1 (Non-Cancellation Postulate):**  
The total complex amplitude of a physical configuration is constrained
such that exact global cancellation is forbidden.

This is the Origin Axiom itself.
It is not derived and is treated as a fundamental postulate.

---

**A2 (Existence of a Global Configuration Amplitude):**  
Physical systems admit a well-defined global complex amplitude
(e.g. a sum or integral over local degrees of freedom).

This assumption is required for the axiom to be meaningfully stated.

---

## 2. Structural Assumptions (Conceptual)

**A3 (Global Constraint Validity):**  
The Origin Axiom acts as a global constraint on configuration space,
not as a local dynamical equation.

As such, standard locality-based no-go arguments may not apply.

---

**A4 (Allowance for Nonlocal or Topological Structure):**  
At sufficiently fundamental scales, global or topological constraints
may exist without violating observed low-energy locality.

This assumption is consistent with several approaches to quantum gravity
but is not derived here.

---

## 3. Modeling Assumptions (Replaceable)

**A5 (Toy Scalar Field Representation):**  
Phase 1 uses scalar field toy models to explore the consequences of
the Origin Axiom.

This choice is made for minimality and tractability.
No claim is made that scalar fields dominate the real vacuum.

---

**A6 (Finite-Dimensional and Lattice Models):**  
Finite lattices and discretized systems are used as stand-ins for
continuum physics.

These models are not assumed to be fundamental and may be replaced
in later phases.

---

**A7 (Uniform Constraint Enforcement):**  
When the non-cancellation constraint is enforced, it is applied uniformly
across degrees of freedom to minimize artificial structure.

This is a modeling choice, not an axiom.

---

## 4. Numerical and Practical Assumptions

**A8 (Finite Resolution and Precision):**  
All numerical simulations operate at finite resolution and precision.

Observed residuals are therefore interpreted structurally,
not as numerical artifacts.

---

**A9 (Representative Parameter Choices):**  
Parameter values (e.g. lattice size, ε) are chosen to illustrate
qualitative behavior, not to match physical scales exactly.

Scaling arguments are used where appropriate.

---

## 5. Explicit Non-Assumptions (Clarifying)

Phase 1 explicitly does **not** assume:

- ❌ A complete or fundamental quantum field theory
- ❌ Exact locality at all scales
- ❌ Lorentz invariance of the toy models
- ❌ Dominance of Standard Model fields in vacuum energy
- ❌ A specific quantum gravity framework
- ❌ Any preferred numerical constants or ratios
- ❌ That the axiom arises from symmetry breaking or dynamics

---

## 6. Scope Reminder

These assumptions are sufficient only to support Phase 1 results:
the existence of a nonzero residual under cancellation frustration.

They do not justify further claims without additional structure,
which is deferred to later phases.
