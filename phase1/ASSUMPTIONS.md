# Phase 1 Assumptions & Limitations

A1: A global amplitude A can be meaningfully defined for a toy system (phasor sum; lattice mean field).
A2: The Origin Axiom is a global/nonlocal constraint, not a local dynamical field equation.
A3: Numerical lattice model is an existence proof only; it is not claimed to be the Standard Model vacuum.
A4: ε is a free positive parameter in Phase 1. We do not derive ε here.
A5: We do not assume any specific θ* value; we only require “not perfectly cancelling”.
A6: Any link to cosmological constant magnitude is qualitative in Phase 1 unless explicitly derived.
A7: Regularization/continuum limits are not proven in Phase 1; any such discussion is labeled “outlook”.
