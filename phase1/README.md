# Phase 1: Minimal Origin Axiom Core

This directory contains **Phase 1** of the Origin Axiom project.

Phase 1 is intentionally narrow in scope. Its sole purpose is to establish,
with maximal clarity and reproducibility, a **minimal non-cancellation principle**
(the Origin Axiom) and demonstrate via toy models that enforcing a global
non-zero amplitude floor prevents perfect destructive interference.

No phenomenology, flavor physics, θ★, φ, or unification claims are made here.

## What Phase 1 Does

Phase 1 establishes:

- A **θ-agnostic axiom**: a global complex amplitude A is forbidden from vanishing exactly  
  (|A| > ε for some ε > 0).
- Simple **finite-dimensional toy models** (phasor interference) showing why exact
  cancellation is non-generic once a non-cancellation rule is enforced.
- A **numerical existence proof** using a lattice toy model, demonstrating that
  enforcing |A| ≥ ε prevents deep cancellation without destabilizing dynamics.
- A **scaling study** comparing unconstrained cancellation (residual → 0 with size)
  versus constrained cancellation (residual saturates at ε).

Phase 1 does *not* attempt to solve the cosmological constant problem fully.
It demonstrates plausibility and coherence only.

## What Phase 1 Explicitly Excludes

Phase 1 **does not include**:

- θ★ or any flavor-physics-derived parameter
- φ or φ^φ arguments or numerology
- CKM / PMNS / neutrino phenomenology
- Claims of unification
- Claims of experimental confirmation
- Claims of necessity or uniqueness

All such topics are deferred to later phases.

## Quickstart (Reproduce Phase 1)

From the **repository root**:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[phase1]"
snakemake -s phase1/workflow/Snakefile -c1 all
```

This command will:

- run all Phase 1 simulations,
- regenerate all Phase 1 figures,
- compile the Phase 1 paper PDF.

---

## Outputs

After a successful run:

- Figures:  
  `phase1/outputs/figures/`
- Run artifacts (raw data + metadata):  
  `phase1/outputs/runs/<run_id>/`
- Paper PDF:  
  `phase1/paper/main.pdf`

Each run directory contains a `meta.json` file recording:
- git commit hash
- timestamp
- random seed
- parameters
- Python and dependency versions

---

## Reproducibility Guarantee

Phase 1 follows a strict reproducibility contract:

- All stochastic runs use fixed, recorded seeds.
- Outputs are immutable (never overwritten).
- Every figure is generated by code.
- The paper PDF is built as part of the pipeline.
- All assumptions are explicitly documented.

See `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` for details.

## How Phase 1 Fits Into the Larger Project

Phase 1 is designed to be **forward-compatible**:

- Phase 2 may connect ε to cosmological dynamics.
- Phase 3 may introduce θ★ as an emergent or fitted quantity.
- Phase 4 may explore predictions or falsifiability.
- Phase 5 may synthesize into a broader framework.

Phase 1 itself makes no claims beyond demonstrating a coherent,
minimal non-cancellation principle.
