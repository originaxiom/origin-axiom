\section{Act V: Towards a dynamical \texorpdfstring{$\thetastar$}{theta*}}
\label{sec:act5-dynamical-theta}

In Acts~II--IV the bridge phase $\thetastar$ entered as an externally
determined parameter with a posterior band derived from flavour fits, and
was subsequently wired into toy vacuum microstructure and FRW cosmologies.
In this Act we take a first step towards treating $\thetastar$ as a dynamical
variable governed by an effective potential.
