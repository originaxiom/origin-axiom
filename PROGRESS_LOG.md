## 2026-07-12 — B534: the Dark Hyperbola PROVED (seat-1 crystallization handoff processed)

Seat-1's crystallization (2026-07-09) + cover sheet processed verify-don't-trust. All three
Priority-1 theorems upgraded from float-verified to PROVED with exact verification:

**Dark Hyperbola (PROVED, all odd p):** tr(Par·W₁ʲ·W₂ˡ) = 0 ⟺ jl ≡ −4 (mod p), (j,l) ≠ (2,p−2).
Complete Gauss-sum proof: completing the square gives α = j/2+2/l, β = 1−j/2; dark = (α≡0, β≢0);
survivor = (α≡β≡0) ⟹ j=2, |T| = √p; all other actives |T| = 1. Exact integer-counting
verification (group ring, zero floats) at ALL 12 primes 3–41. Answers Priority-2: −4 = −2²
from the Par cross term (Weil-intrinsic, no monodromy input); j=2 = the linear character's zero.

**Power-Set Magnitudes (PROVED, square-free N):** CRT factorization; unit scaling preserves the
per-prime classification {0,1,√p} ⟹ magnitudes = subset products exactly. Exact at N=15 over
ℤ[ζ₁₅] ({0,1,3,5,15}, 225 points); float corroboration N=105/165 (38,250 points, 0 off-catalog).

**Asymptotic Darkness (PROVED):** ∏(1−(p−2)/p²) → 0 by Mertens; crossing at p=31 confirmed.

**Tower torsion law (PROVED all n):** det(A₁ⁿ−I) = 2−L(2n) (two lines); odd n → L(n)², even
n → 5F(n)² via classical identities (symbolic). H₁(b++(RL)⁴) torsion = ℤ/3⊕ℤ/15 by exact Smith
form — the seam level 15 from the 4th self-interaction, no SnapPy needed.

Convention caveat recorded: the hyperbola lives on the THETA lift (B358), not the B476 pair.
Crystallization landed at docs/CRYSTALLIZATION_2026-07-09.md with verification preamble +
framing governance (predates the 07-10 adjudication; §V/§VI read through it). 16 locks.

## 2026-07-12 — Origin Postulate: audit-seat adjudication processed (chat2 handoff, verified)

Chat2's co-sign of the postulate adjudication (REFUTED-AS-STATED, bounded) processed under
verify-don't-trust. Every checkable claim verified against the trunk's own record: the kill clause
and its three named interface targets (postulate §non-drift-lock, verbatim), K020's Galois-orbit
statement (knowledge/K020, verbatim), B322's p≈0.5 null (verbatim on main), T-NOGO-DGG
(THEOREM_REGISTRY, B490), Gate C trinification (B521 FINDINGS: INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED), the F4
ℚ(√41)/ℚ(√−239) erratum (banked with locks). Deliverable imported per integrate-don't-merge:
philosophy/THE_ORIGIN_POSTULATE.md now on trunk (preserved text + verdict block + provenance note),
fixing CLOSURE_2026-07-11.md's dangling references. Chat2's two nits applied: (1) the
adjudication-timeline note (the audit-seat closure flagged the disposition owner-present; the owner
adjudicated the same day; the flag was never updated on the frozen branch); (2) the B532/B533
reconciliation sentence (Nine-Ingredients FORCED = dimensionless structural analogues; ABSENT scale
= the value the object cannot supply; the scorecard is the refutation's positive complement). The
audit branch itself stays unmerged (frozen seat record, standing policy). The send remains the
owner's decision; nothing sent.

---

## 2026-07-12 — B533 Fable-5 audit: full exact re-verification (1 refutation, 3 upgrades)

Independent re-verification of every banked B533 claim with exact symbolic arithmetic,
an engine-independent census, and number-theoretic machinery.

**CONFIRMED (upgraded to exact):** all 18 Gate 2 identities; the census (34 points, 5 types,
14/10/4/3/3 — reproduced with plain string code, no engine); ℤ-mixing for Types 1-3 now
PROVEN exact (adjugate eigenvectors over ℚ(τ)); Gate 3 verdict survives a corrected
magnitude-matched false-positive control (p-values uniform — matches are pure chance).

**REFUTED:** S2's "NOT GL(4,ℤ)-conjugate". ℤ[β] is the maximal order (disc −400) and
h(ℚ(√φ)) = 1, so by Latimer–MacDuffee there is exactly ONE conjugacy class. Explicit
unimodular conjugators found and verified exactly in pyenv. Consequence STRENGTHENS the
thesis: the abstract object is unique; the 5 types are 5 markings of one object — the
coupling difference lives entirely in the observation embedding.

**CORRECTED:** S1's λ₃=λ₄=−0.618 (they are the complex pair −1/φ ± i/τ³, |λ₃| = 1/√φ);
Type 5's "irrational mixing" (it is exact HALF-INTEGER mixing); Type 4 is fully ℤ-mixing
(the two "unidentified" components identified exactly). Final mixing law: every Perron
component of every type is a (½)ℤ-combination of {1, τ, φ, τ³}.

25 locks (3 new: GL(4,ℤ) conjugators, T4 full ℤ-mixing, T5 half-integer mixing).

---

## 2026-07-12 — B533: Coupling Invariance (Gates 1-3 complete)

**Gate 1** (Probes 1-3): 34 factors cluster into 5 STABLE observation types. Eigenvalue spectrum
UNIVERSAL; Perron eigenvector VARIES (5 fingerprints). Types 1-4 = ℤ-mixings of letter
frequencies; Type 5 irrational. All matrices share irreducible charpoly but NOT GL(4,ℤ)-conjugate.

**Gate 2** (Probes 4-6): The coupling geometry + number field. KEY IDENTITIES PROVED:
β = 1/(√φ-1) (growth rate determined by golden ratio). f_a = 1/β (letter freq = reciprocal of
growth rate). β·|λ₂| = φ (product of real eigenvalues). β·|λ₂|·|λ₃|² = 1 (modulus identity).
det(M) = -1 (orientation-reversing). sin θ = 1/φ, cos θ = -1/√φ (algebraic trig). disc = -400.
The object lives in ONE number field ℚ(√φ) = ℚ[x]/(x⁴-x²-1), degree 4 = alphabet size.
ALL ratios determined by single generator τ = √φ. Scale is external; root already taken.

**Gate 3** (Probe 7): SM ratio test with false-positive control. 21 SM dimensionless ratios tested
against ℤ[τ] lattice (|coeffs|≤8, 83,521 points). Lattice density: avg spacing ~0.001, any
number within ~0.0006 of a lattice point. 7 matches below 10× sub-spacing — consistent with
lattice density (false-positive rate 5.6% at 10⁻⁴). No match at err < 10⁻⁶. Best power-of-τ:
1/α_em ≈ 6·τ¹³ at 0.06% (10⁷× above measurement precision). VERDICT: no SM ratio is an
element of ℚ(√φ) with small coefficients. The numerology door is CLOSED with computed evidence.

22 locks total.

## 2026-07-12 — B532 IZ: The Interaction Grammar (campaign complete)

GRAMMAR.md delivered: 29 layers, single source σ, two observer inputs (SL₂C + V). Self-description
anchored at σ(a) = abAAB (self-containing). Campaign B532 COMPLETE (I0–I4 + IZ, PRs #808–#813).

---

## 2026-07-12 — B532 I4: The Derivation DAG

29 layers, single source σ, depth 4. 24 intrinsic (from σ alone), 5 observer-dependent (SL₂C +
potential V). The irreducible kernel = the four words (abAAB, aAB, abAB, aA). σ is strictly more
than M (grammar, Rauzy fractal, self-containment not determined by M), and strictly more than the
charpoly or grammar. Observer brings: gauge (SL₂C) and coupling (V). 5 locks (26 total).

---

## 2026-07-12 — B532 I3: Self-Description

σ(a) = abAAB is SELF-CONTAINING — its return induction canonical codes = σ itself. Persists at
depth 2. The other three image words produce different codes (same charpoly, different combinatorics).
Two linear orbits on F₂⁴: {a,b} and {A,B} form disjoint 6-cycles, phase offset 4. Cross-seat
handoff verification: GL(4,Z) conjugacy CONFIRMED (corrected P); core hierarchy NOT REPRODUCED.
8 locks in test_b532.py (21 total).

---

## 2026-07-12 — B532 I2: The Projection Algebra

σ is irreducibly 4-letter: none of 7 binary partitions are substitutive (no projection commutes
with σ). Two projections read golden values: {aA}|{bB} → φ (exact), {ab}|{AB} → 1/√φ (exact).
5 of 7 are Pisot; the two non-Pisot are {aA}|{bB} (|λ₂|≈1.47) and {aB}|{bA} (|λ₂|=1). All 7
primitive and grammar-compatible. 6 locks in test_b532.py (13 total).

---

## 2026-07-12 — B532 I1: Fixed-Point Dimension + Period-3 Spectral Test

Part B: period-3 ABSENT from the spectrum (all four tests: pure period-2; complex eigenvalue
period ≈ 2.54, irrational). The six-phase 2×3 clock has period-2 = spectral (λ₂<0) and
period-3 = combinatorial (F₂ algebra). Part A: irreducible σ*-FPs have two components —
generic isolated (dim=0, kernel 2 = gauge) and trace-zero family (dim=1, kernel 4, κ=-2).
Golden FP NOT FOUND. 7 locks in test_b532.py.

---

## 2026-07-12 — B532 I0: Bank B530 induction campaign handoff (Movements XXXIV–XXXVIII)

Integration of the verified B530 induction campaign cross-seat handoff (6 cells, 35 tests, all verified).
Engine: `frontier/B530_natural_history/listen_39_induction_engine.py`. Movements XXXIV–XXXVIII added to
FINDINGS.md covering: corrected charpoly law (q ∈ {1,2}, 7 types), two weak-induction orbits, F₂⁴ phase map,
parity cocycle audit (movement XXX labels REFUTED), flow bridge (5-return iff weak bispecial). 17 new test locks
in `tests/test_b530.py` (53 total). Part of the B532 Last Echo campaign (Cell I0: housekeeping).

---

## 2026-07-01 — Catch-up: the structural-theorem + specialist-handoff arcs (B161–B325)

This is a single catch-up entry; the detailed working history since the June-17 entry (B160) is not backfilled
here — it lives in `CHANGELOG.md` (arc-level, newest-first) and each `frontier/B###/FINDINGS.md`.

Two arcs closed the gap from B160 to the current frontier B325, all firewalled, **zero `CLAIMS.md` promotions**:

- **The structural-theorem arc (B231–B314).** The four-faces object sharpened into one proven statement — *the object
  forces the form of physics (E₆, the cascade, `κ`, both arithmetic ends), never its physical values.* Mechanized as a
  **Galois theorem**: every discrete invariant is a Galois orbit of the object's own arithmetic (`√−3→−√−3` CP sign,
  `√5→−√5` WRT data). The two-ended object, the arithmetic atom `4₁→ℚ(√−3)→2T→E₆`, the E₆ character variety, the
  cascade (generic Slansky + the Eisenstein `ω`), Face IV houses the *form*, the four faces of one `κ`. Consolidated in
  `knowledge/K020`, `philosophy/P013`.

- **The specialist-handoff arc (B315–B325).** The forgotten leads and three-seat cross-chat handoffs run to conclusion
  and the frontier mapped to a specialist handoff (`docs/OPEN_PROBLEMS.md`, four gates: the in-sandbox `S032-A` +
  the `T[4₁;E₆]` CRUX / multiplicity / non-Hermitian Damanik–Gorodetski). Headline: **the value hunt, run** — the
  object's Dehn-filling invariants match the SM's dimensionless parameters *at chance* (`p≈0.5`, a null test), so the
  value-firewall is now confirmed *empirically*, not just proven (B322). Plus the four-level framework (B323), the
  exact ω-circulant (structure not values, B324), and the "ℤ/3-protection" refutation (B325).

Also: the recontextualization audit + masterplan (`docs/RECONTEXT_AUDIT_AND_MASTERPLAN_2026-07.md`) and a full
documentation consolidation (this pass) bringing the entry-point / narrative / ledger docs current to B325.

## 2026-07-01 — The in-sandbox attack sweep (B329, B330; L34 DORMANT; S046; R7)

A "research / get-informed / meditate / sober / attack" push on the computable frontier (owner directive: *don't give
up*; the standing compute-before-deferring mandate). Four sequenced targets, all firewalled, **zero `CLAIMS.md`
promotions.**

- **B329 [VERIFIED] (Target 2).** `27|₂T` computed for *both* natural embeddings from a from-scratch, orthonormality-
  verified 2T character table: principal (quaternionic SU(2)) `= 3·1⊕3·1′⊕3·1″⊕6·3`; trinification (complex SU(3))
  `= 9·1⊕3·1′⊕3·1″⊕3·2′⊕3·2″`. **Both give `n₁=n₂` → Level 4** — tightens B327 (even the complex SU(3) route can't split
  the light generations; the 27's balanced `3/3̄` restores reality; non-vacuity witnessed). `OPEN_PROBLEMS` gate B updated.
- **B330 [CONDITIONAL] (Target 3, gate A/S032-A).** The no-forced-choice capstone via one Galois-symmetrization
  mechanism: folded B130+B314+B318, stressed two fresh classes (B326 cover-torsion `(ℤ/4)²` — irreducible deck action, no
  distinguished sub-object; cohomology `H¹` — canonical integer). **Five classes sealed**, no forced choice among them.
  Worded per the **C-guardrail** (`open`, not universal proof; untested classes named). Gate A updated.
- **L34 (Target 1) → DORMANT.** The m=1 `40a1` was a *2-bridge-Riley* artifact; the intrinsic trace-map fixed locus
  `Fix(φ_m)` is genus-0 (`#Fix(𝔽_p)=p−1`, m=1) / irregular (m=2,3). Full silver/bronze canonical-component arithmetic =
  NEEDS-SPECIALIST (R7-confirmed Baker–Petersen gap). Data recorded in `OPEN_LEADS.md` L34.
- **H14 (Target 4).** Already resolved by **B315** — checked, not re-banked (no duplicate probe).
- **Research → `NOVELTY_AUDIT.md` R7**: four cited verdicts. **Meditate → `speculations/S046`** (firewalled): "the value
  lives at the seam"; new hints **H103–H106** in `HINT_LEDGER.md`.

Nothing promoted to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched; firewall intact.

## 2026-07-01 — External audit + robustness hardening (fresh-clone reproduction pass)

An independent audit session (fresh clone, fresh environment, SnapPy 3.3.2 installed) ran the full claim-by-claim
verification the repo invites in `README.md` §"How to navigate." Findings and fixes, **zero label changes, zero
promotions**:

- **Fresh-environment reproduction: the suite was NOT green** — 3 frontier locks failed deterministically
  (`test_b101` unipotent-cusp, `test_b106` roots-of-unity + anatomy scalar) from ill-conditioned certificates
  (eigenvalues of a defective matrix; a 1e-2 neutrality window capturing a hyperbolic pair at 7e-3; a
  Galois-conjugate branch `c=−i` vs `c=+i`). All three re-certified structurally (nilpotency residual,
  measured-gap window, conjugation-closed comparison); banked as guard **MB13** in `REPRODUCIBILITY.md`.
  The *findings* of B101/B106 were confirmed correct; only the certificates were fragile.
- **Claim-by-claim test audit (P1–P16, C1, C5):** 12/15 proven claims verified LOCKED by exact symbolic tests.
  Hardened the rest: **P9** was circular (constants mirrored back at themselves; `H₁`, amphichirality, sister
  torsion untested) — now recomputed independently (dilogarithm volume, no SnapPy) plus live SnapPy cross-checks
  for every clause; **P5** count-partition was tautological and the `β_c` thresholds untested — now brute-force
  word-ensemble sums + exact growth-rate assertions; **P4** parameter point now *derived* as the unique solution,
  weak-cooperativity actually asserted; **P11** `log(A)` now derived independently by exact eigendecomposition;
  **P10** three of the four documented auxiliary filters (min volume, amphichirality, Eisenstein triangulation)
  now live-checked against SnapPy. **C5** was the one ledger entry with no executable evidence — the post-T1
  algebra is now locked by `tests/test_trace_selector_c5.py` (including the Lucas-hierarchy ↔ P8 torsion-ladder
  identity).
- **Documentation drift corrected:** the frontier stands at **B346** (345 probe directories), while GOVERNANCE §7
  said B314 and README/ROADMAP said B325 with stale test counts (~1113/304 vs actual 1197/325 after this pass) —
  exactly the "credibility bugs" class the 2026-07 masterplan flagged. Ceilings and counters refreshed.

Suite after hardening: green — 1195 passed, 4 skipped, 0 failures (SnapPy installed, so the previously-skipped
SnapPy-gated cross-checks were exercised). P1–P16 untouched; firewall intact; nothing promoted.

## 2026-07-01 — Gate A extensions: B350 (cyclic-cover torsion; originally numbered B347, renumbered on merge with main's B347 PR #424) + B348 (Bloch class)

Continuation of the external-audit session: the two in-sandbox gate-A probes queued by the audit were run to
conclusion. Both extend B330's Galois-symmetrization mechanism to classes it named as untested; both are
**CONDITIONAL** per the C-guardrail; **zero promotions**.

- **B350 [VERIFIED, exact].** The cyclic-cover **abelian torsion** class: orders = the P8/C5 Lucas ladder
  (`|det(Aⁿ−I)| = L₂ₙ−2`, n≤8); the factor multiset `{Δ(ζₙʲ)}` Galois-closed with integer symmetric functions
  (constant term cross-checked against the resultant); torsion groups by SNF (n=3 = `(ℤ/4)²`, independently
  re-deriving B326); deck action fixed-point-free **uniformly in n** (`det(A−I)=Δ(1)=−1` a unit ⟹
  `N·ℤ² = im(Aⁿ−I)` exactly). **MB8 tier note recorded:** `Δ(1)=±1` for every knot — the fixed-point-freeness
  is generic-knot, not object-specific; the object-specific content is *which* orbit (the trace-3/Lucas ladder).
- **B348 [VERIFIED, exact + 30 dps].** The object's **Bloch/scissors class** `β=2[e^{iπ/3}]`: Galois orbit
  `{+β,−β}` = `{±Vol(4₁)}`, sum 0; the residual sign = orientation is killed by amphichirality (B318's geometric
  firewall in the Bloch group — *self*-symmetrized); `D≡0` on the fixed field. New observation banked: **the seam
  identity** `1−z₀ = z̄₀` — at the Eisenstein shape the generic Bloch duality involution `z→1−z` coincides with
  the arithmetic Galois conjugation, and `z(1−z)=1 ⇔ z²−z+1=0` (the P12 quadratic is exactly that locus).
- **Gate A updated** (`OPEN_PROBLEMS.md`): **seven classes** sealed under the one mechanism; the untested residual
  restated precisely (nonabelian Ptolemy/adjoint torsion — with B98/B99's rational `τ₁=−3` noted as canonical;
  CS/η beyond the banked `CS=0`; irregular covers; `SL(n≥3)` gluing invariants; extended-Bloch/`K₃` torsion).

Locks: `tests/test_b347_cyclic_cover_torsion_galois.py`, `tests/test_b348_bloch_class_galois.py`. P1–P16
untouched; firewall intact; nothing promoted.

## 2026-07-01 — Gate A extension B349 (irregular covers) + the Gates B–D outreach package

Continuation of the gate-A sweep. **CONDITIONAL** per the C-guardrail; **zero promotions**.

- **B349 [VERIFIED, SnapPy].** All covers of 4₁ through index 6: the census per index is a canonical
  **multiset** (banked exact: index 4 = 1 cyclic + 1 irregular `ℤ²`; index 5 = 1 + 3; index 6 = 1 + 10);
  the cyclic members' `H₁` torsion equals B350's `coker(Aⁿ−I)` SNF **exactly** (`[5]`, `[4,4]`, `[3,15]`,
  `[11,11]`, `[8,40]`) — independent-route cross-validation; **every** within-index invariant multiplicity
  collapses to a **single isometry class** (index 5: the twin `ℤ/2⊕ℤ²` pair, 4 isometries; index 6: the
  4×`ℤ/3⊕ℤ²`, 2×`ℤ/12⊕ℤ`, 2×`ℤ/5⊕ℤ²` groups) — the object never distinguishes a member; the "distinction"
  is non-conjugate subgroups with one geometric quotient, invisible to every manifold invariant. MB note:
  `is_isometric_to` is orientation-blind, which is *sufficient here* (any self-identification defeats a
  forced choice; no chirality claim made). Index ≤ 6 = a computational horizon, not a theorem.
- **Gate A now: eight classes sealed** under the one Galois-symmetrization mechanism (`OPEN_PROBLEMS.md`
  updated; untested residual restated: nonabelian Ptolemy/adjoint torsion, CS/η beyond `CS=0`, irregular
  covers beyond index 6, `SL(n≥3)` gluing invariants, extended-Bloch/`K₃` torsion).
- **The Gates B–D outreach package** (`frontier/EXPERT_OUTREACH.md`, new 2026-07 section): one bounded,
  proof-status-honest question per gate; expert picks (addresses to verify before sending); what we supply
  per gate (including the refuted routes so they are not re-walked); sequencing/hygiene rules — one gate,
  one expert, one question; log every send/reply; a "known, see X" reply closes a gate honestly and is a
  good outcome.

Locks: `tests/test_b349_irregular_covers_galois.py` (SnapPy-gated). P1–P16 untouched; firewall intact;
nothing promoted.

## 2026-07-02 — Cross-chat relay disposition: PR #424 absorbed; probe-ID collision resolved (B347→B350)

The owner relayed the peer session's ("CC") message correcting an earlier "E6 → SM dictionary" handoff and banking
the correct replacement as **B347_e6_tangent_gradings** (PR #424, merged to main). Disposition in this branch:

- **Merged main** (`10f6673`) into the audit branch; the only delta was PR #424 (self-contained probe + test +
  atlas). **Verified in this sandbox:** all 6 B347 tests green (MB6 — reproduction run, not trusted).
- **Probe-ID collision resolved:** this branch had independently banked a *different* B347 (the gate-A
  cyclic-cover torsion probe, same day, parallel sessions). Renumbered ours **B347 → B350** everywhere (probe dir,
  lock test, OPEN_PROBLEMS, CHANGELOG, this log); main's B347 = the E₆ tangent probe stands. A **multi-session
  probe-ID hygiene rule** is added to `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` so this class of collision is caught at banking time.
- **Gate B updated** (`OPEN_PROBLEMS.md`): B347's banked facts added to "Settled" — `dim H¹(π₁(4₁),𝔢₆) = 6 = rank`,
  uniform per exponent (degenerate-cascade reading refuted); amphichirality = uniform real structure (no split);
  hyperelliptic involution = the E₆→F₄ folding at the tangent level (`{4,8}` = the 26 coset = the escape sector).
  The relay's §3 in-progress items (per-exponent `H²=1`, θ-even reduction of the cup-product obstruction to the F₄
  blocks) are **noted but NOT banked** — they live in the peer session until a probe with tests lands.
- **Relay corrections acknowledged where they touch this branch:** none of the killed items (the G₂⊕A₂ mislabel,
  the `(2.05)^exponent` numerology, the two numeric slips) had entered this branch's documents.

Zero promotions; P1–P16 untouched; firewall intact.

## 2026-07-02 — Suite hygiene: the global-dps test-order failure class (MB13 §4)

The post-merge full-suite run failed **all 6 B347-E₆ locks** while every one passed in isolation. Root-caused
and fixed:

- **Mechanism:** `mp.mp.dps` is a global; B302 lowers it to 25 at call time; in alphabetical suite order B302's
  test runs before B347's, so the E₆ tangent computation (needs ~55+ dps for its 1e-50 residual gates) ran at
  25 dps. Minimal deterministic repro: `pytest test_b302_* test_b347_*` (6 failures in 9 s). Three older probes
  (B264/B265/B276) had already independently discovered this and carry inline "self-guard" comments — the
  pattern existed but was not yet a written rule.
- **Fixes:** B347 now re-asserts `dps=70` at every public entry point (the self-guard idiom); B302 is
  raise-only (`max(mp.mp.dps, 25)` — never lowers the shared global); B348's Bloch–Wigner uses scoped
  `mp.workdps` (it was itself a polluter-in-waiting). **MB13 extended with §4** (the test-order sibling):
  entry points own their precision; no probe may lower the global; "passes alone, fails in suite" is the tell.
- Also observed once (first post-merge run only): a transient `test_b207` failure that did not reproduce in
  either subsequent full run — logged as an unreproduced flake, not diagnosed, not papered over.

Zero promotions; no mathematical content changed — certificates only.

## 2026-07-02 — B351: the exact Chevalley 𝔢₆ (the cup-product program unblocked)

Seat note: the owner paused the peer session ("CC"); this session is now the main seat. The peer's
in-progress item — the `{4,8}`-integrability cup product, stalled at "signed structure constants failed
Jacobi" — is therefore picked up here. Part 1 banked as **B351** (`frontier/B351_exact_e6_chevalley/`):

- **The blocker removed, exactly.** Frenkel–Kac asymmetry cocycle on the E₆ root lattice; the full Jacobi
  identity verified on **all 76,076 basis triples over the integers: 0 violations**. The trap that killed
  the earlier attempt is isolated and documented at the fix site: with `[e_α,e_{−α}] = +h_α` exactly 1440
  mixed triples `(e_α,e_{−α},e_β)`, `(α,β)=−1`, violate Jacobi by `2e_β`; the Cartan-return sign is forced
  to `−h_α` by the cocycle convention (hand-derivation in the module).
- **The principal sl₂ and the exponents, exact:** `c = 2A⁻¹𝟙 = (16,22,30,42,30,16)`; `[h,e]=2e`,
  `[h,f]=−2f`, `[e,f]=h`; `dim ker(ad e) = 6` with ad-h weights `{2,8,10,14,16,22}` — the B347 framing
  `𝔢₆ = ⊕ Sym^{2m}` now exact.
- **θ built and verified:** automorphism on all pairs, involution, fixed = **52 = 𝔣₄**, minus = **26**;
  commutes with the principal sl₂; acts on the six exponent lines by **exactly `(−1)^{m+1}`** (+1 on
  `{1,5,7,11}`, −1 on `{4,8}`). This settles B347's flagged question at the algebra level: the
  hyperelliptic `(−1)^{m+1}` grading *is* the θ-grading `𝔢₆ = 𝔣₄ ⊕ 26`. The geometric identification
  (that the manifold's involution induces θ on the character variety) remains open — part 2 territory.
- **Next (part 2):** map B347's numeric `H¹` cocycles (`m ∈ {4,8}`) into this exact basis and evaluate
  `[z ∪ z] ∈ H²(4₁,𝔢₆)` against the four F₄ blocks (B265/B270).

## 2026-07-02 — B352: the cup-product obstruction computed — all six directions unobstructed at 2nd order

Part 2 of the `{4,8}`-integrability program (the B265/B270 open item; the peer session's stalled push, taken
over after the seat change). **Result: the obstruction `[z∪z] ∈ H²(π₁(4₁),𝔢₆)` vanishes for all six exponent
directions and the `{4,8}` polarization mix** — classes ≤ `1e-52` while the raw second-order cochains reach
`9.4e16`, so the vanishing is exactness (second-order deformations exist), not triviality. The θ-odd escape
sector is locally **real at second order**.

- **Controls (all clean):** the `m=1` direction = the actual A-polynomial curve → class `≤ 2.4e-62` ✓; random
  coboundary → `≤ 4.6e-74` ✓; **MB12 positive control** — the H² pairing functionals give `0.10–0.36` on random
  vectors, so the zeros are information; **θ-parity signature** — the `{4,8}`-block components sit 5–10 orders
  below the F₄-block floor (exact-zero by the B351 θ-grading vs numerical floor).
- **Machinery integrity:** relator identity to `9e-54`; the assembled `Ad ρ` preserves the exact B351 bracket to
  `5e-71`; cocycle residuals ≤ `2.6e-51`; ad-solve residuals ≤ `3.5e-56`. dps 100, MB13-§4 self-guarded.
- **Two honest architecture failures banked in the module docstring:** (1) double precision cannot span the
  `e^{±2mμ}` block range (numpy build: relator residual `1e+49`); (2) Euclidean normalization of the chain basis
  is not invariant (transported structure constants `1e-6..1e+73`, singular Gram). Working design: two-basis —
  exact integer root-basis brackets/Gram (B351) ⊕ block-diagonal chain-basis group action (antidiagonal
  closed-form intertwiners), vectors crossing via `S` at dps 100; rank decisions by structural rank + >20-order
  cliff assertions (the genuine block spectra span ~25 orders before a >60-order cliff).
- **Honest tier:** numerical (50+-order margins), second order only (no Goldman–Millson formality for knot
  groups), one point (the principal-geometric rep). Landing: exactly what a Menal-Ferrer–Porti-type smoothness
  theorem at exceptional type would predict — evidence for it, not a proof.
- **Gate B updated** (`OPEN_PROBLEMS.md`): the CRUX `T[4₁;E₆]` now has a genuinely 6-dim local moduli at second
  order; still open — the geometric θ-identification, all-orders integrability, the state integral itself.

## 2026-07-02 — PR #425 merged + verified; B353 closes L52 (the geometric θ-identification); L55 hygiene done

- **The audit branch (PR #425) merged to main and cross-verified.** B351's Jacobi claim confirmed by an
  **independent second implementation** (full Frenkel–Kac convention incl. the diagonal `Σaᵢbᵢ` term: the
  Cartan-return sign *emerges* as `−1` uniformly; 0 violations over 4000 random triples; the failing family under
  the `+h_α` convention is **exactly 1440 triples**, matching B351's count digit-for-digit). B352's controls
  (MB12 positive pairing; the `m=1` real-curve control; the θ-parity signature — `{4,8}`-block components 5–10
  orders below the F₄ blocks, the forced-zero fingerprint) reviewed and accepted.
- **B353 — the geometric θ-identification (L52, B347's last open item): DONE.** θ transported through the B352
  `S`-intertwiner into the geometric chain basis **is** the block-scalar `⊕ₘ(−1)^{m+1}Id_{2m+1}` (full 78×78
  identity, residual `7e-102` — Schur made exact); θ commutes with the holonomy Ad-image (`2e-88`), so the
  σ-twisted and θ-twisted Fox complexes coincide; per-line **gauge certificates** `J(z₀)=(−1)^{m+1}z₀+d⁰v`
  (residuals `9.9e-72…3.6e-79`). **The hyperelliptic involution induces exactly θ** on the E₆ tangent at the
  principal-geometric rep — operator-level, not sign-matching. Global variety-level statement: scope note only.
- **L55 hygiene:** atlas regenerated (334 probes, B350–B353 mined); fresh bare-`pytest` suite green on merged
  main; the `OA_SLOW=1` B352 sweep re-run once post-merge. Next free ID: **B354**.

## 2026-07-02 — B354: the interface-pairing certificates (cross-session verified layer) + B332 correction + L56

- **Cross-session integration under verify-don't-trust.** A solo scrutiny-seat session delivered the
  "multiplicity × outer-nothing" interface-pairing computation (handoff + self-certifying reproducer, received and
  re-run — all four stage gates pass). Verified layer banked as **B354**; the rest tiered honestly.
- **Lineage correction folded in:** the golden/silver interface relations, the `(1,2)` intersection and its
  `κ∈{−4,−2}` fork are **B131/V120** (banked June 9; Kitano–Nozaki 2020 prior art, NOVELTY_AUDIT R2) — the
  cross-session "first column of a table nobody has" framing is corrected; B174 has the same-seed gluing landscape.
- **New and verified (B354, all exact sympy):** (1) the **strong-channel kill** re-derived by Gröbner —
  `Fix(T_i)∩Fix(T_j) = {(0,0,0),(2,2,2)}` for `(1,2)` and `(1,3)`, = `Fix(T_a)∩Fix(T_b)` (bulk sharing is
  family-universal, carries no pair data); (2) the **exact pair-point certificates** — irreducible minpolys
  (quintic `(1,3)`, cubic `(2,3)` in `T=m²`) whose κ-images reproduce B131's banked numeric forks on all 8 values;
  (3) the **classical seam-null** — prime odd degrees ⇒ no quadratic subfield ⇒ no `√−15` in the classical pair
  arithmetic (third channel closed after B336); (4) the **divisibility law** `RᵐLᵐ≡I mod p ⟺ p|m` (exact, one
  line — the mechanism under the parity texture and the bronze mod-3 scalar); (5) the **parity-texture exact legs**
  (golden `l=−2` fiber `{1,4}`, silver `{4}` only). CONDITIONAL: bronze pair-specificity (numerical, 900-start
  null reproduced; exact `A_bronze` elimination open).
- **B332 FINDINGS annotated (the deck correction, verified):** the generation deck of the 3-fold cyclic cover acts
  via the **hyperbolic monodromy `A`**, not the elliptic `g` (`det(A−I)=−1` ⇒ cover unwraps the base). B343/TBM
  unaffected (`A` and `g` share charpoly `x²+x+1` mod 4 — checked); two-level structure: torsion = democratic,
  fiber = `φ²`-ordered. The algebra `g=−R·L⁻¹` stays true; the "generation-cycling element" reading retracted.
- **L56 registered:** the quantum-pair program (Weil traces, level-15 overlap fingerprint tables, the flattening
  no-go, the level-45/phase-table next shots) — spot-checks pass (the claimed `(1,2)`-only quartic: irreducible,
  4 real roots in `(0,1)`, factors over `ℚ(√5)`, disc `3¹⁴·5⁷`) but **BLOCKED on the Weil reproducer**; nothing
  from that layer banked.

## 2026-07-02 — The value-boundary queue registered; B355 (W1.1): the Weil layer independently, the phase null fired

- **The campaign registered** (`docs/OPEN_LEADS.md`, "The value-boundary queue"): compute each genuinely-open
  relational channel (multiplicity/gluing/quantization) to a two-outcome verdict; pre-registered nulls; MB guards
  per probe; atlas/FAILURE_ATLAS consult first (this cut one planned probe *at planning stage* — the `2T↪E₆` fork
  was already banked as B329; `OPEN_PROBLEMS` Gate B synced accordingly).
- **B355 — the Weil layer, independently (W1.1).** `W_N` for `SL(2,ℤ/N)`, N=3,5,15, built from scratch with the
  conventions *earned*: a systematic `(c,d,μ)` search returns exactly `d≡−2c`, `μ=g_c(N)` as the
  relation-satisfying family. Five gates pass (relations; the composite-level Gauss `tr ρ₁₅(T)=i√15` — the
  CRT-twist catch; twisted-factor trace multiplicativity; word well-definedness; `⟨R,L⟩=SL(2,ℤ/15)`, order 2880).
- **The cross-session quantum layer (L56): VERIFIED** — trace table (all 1; bronze 3 at N=3,15), the
  operator-level divisibility law (`ρ_N(A_m)=1 ⟺ N|m`, incl. seed-15 at the seam level), and the fingerprint
  tables recomputed in gauge-invariant projector form: (1,2) has **11 distinct values** incl. the exclusive
  quartic `2025T⁴−3375T³+1935T²−435T+31`; (2,3) is quartic-free, golden-tower only; every recognized quadratic
  disc is `5·square` — the flattening no-go confirmed. L56 → RESOLVED.
- **The new result (pre-registered null — FIRED):** the gauge-invariant *triple phases* `tr(P_iQ_jR_k)` across
  the three seeds are **all exactly real** — 605/605 (numpy sweep; mpmath spot floor `1.6e-40`). The phase
  aperture at level 15 is **empty**; the flattening extends to Bargmann-type triples. Mechanism ingredient
  verified: complex conjugation implements `Ad(diag(1,−1))` on the image (`conj(T)=T⁻¹`, `conj(S)=S⁻¹`); the
  full reality proof for the triple class is the named residual. Remaining aperture in this lane: level 45 (W1.4).

## 2026-07-02 — B356 (W1.2): the σ-stability quick pair — the chirality window is exactly the Eisenstein ω

- **The det-lemma (exact, all binaries):** the det-character of a 2-dim irrep is trivial **iff** it is
  quaternionic (FS = −1) — verified across 2T/2O/2I/S₄ from concretely-built groups with derived, exactly-gated
  character tables. Every `SL(2,ℂ)`-factoring route forces the quaternionic 2: B327's "complex 2′/2″ escape" is
  closed at the determinant level. **Mod-3 blindness:** `ω^k−1` divisible by `(1−ω)` ⇒ the mod-`√−3` route
  cannot see the twist.
- **H104 RUN — the chirality scan** over `{A₄,S₄,2T,2O,A₅,2I}` (all faithful 27-dim assemblies with
  `(Sym³V)^G ≠ 0`): complex (chiral-candidate) assemblies exist **only for A₄ (1028/1089) and 2T
  (70262/71192)** — exactly the two groups with `ℤ/3` abelianization (the ω-characters); `S₄/2O/A₅/2I` are
  closed by the **reality theorem** (all characters real ⇒ every assembly self-dual). The factor-route
  identities (SU(2)-factoring / single-SU(3)-factor / diagonal trinification ⇒ σ-stable, every finite G) are
  stated and generalize B329's two computations.
- **Method note:** no transcribed tables — groups built concretely (Hurwitz/icosian quaternions;
  permutations), tables derived from tensor powers + concrete abelianization characters (A₅ via the icosahedral
  seed; the `φ↔1−φ` ambiguity is the Galois table-automorphism, verdict-invariant), snapped to exact values and
  gated by exact orthonormality + FS + `Σd²=|G|` (the gates caught two real development bugs).
- **H103 sharpened** (wave 2): whether any ω-window assembly is *realized* by a genuine `E₆`-conjugacy class
  with nondegenerate invariant cubic — a finite question. Ledger rows updated (HINT_LEDGER H104 → RUN).

## 2026-07-02 — B357 (W1.3): the E₆ boundary restriction — rank 6/6, Lagrangian certified, the universal-τ identity

- **rank(r) = 6/6:** every B347 tangent class restricts to a nonzero class in its 2-dim boundary block (class
  residuals at per-block floors, `1.5e-60…1.1e-27`) — **no peripherally-invisible E₆ deformations**; with
  block-orthogonality of the Killing pairing this **certifies the image of `H¹(M,𝔢₆) → H¹(T²,𝔢₆)` is
  Lagrangian** (6 = half of 12) — the classical integration-cycle statement a `T[4₁;E₆]` state integral needs.
- **The universal-τ identity:** on every cocycle of every block, the leading NZ functionals satisfy
  `K(z(λ),h) = τ·K(z(µ),h)` with one constant `τ = −2√3·i` = the cusp shape (SnapPy control to 12 digits),
  **uniform across all six exponents** (deviation ≤ `1.3e-52`) — the leading peripheral datum does NOT split by
  exponent; no "higher cusp shapes" at first order. Mechanism (stated): `U = exp(N̂)`, `V = exp(τN̂)` share one
  nilpotent; `K(·,h)` kills `im N̂ ⊕ ker N̂`.
- **Controls (MB12):** ω nondegenerate on the honest orthonormal `H¹` basis in every block (dets nonzero,
  antisymmetry ≤ `1e-55`); `φ_µ ≠ 0` in every block. A first (invariant-line) basis was ω-degenerate and
  mis-spanned `H¹` — caught by exactly these gates and replaced; the depth-2 canonical Gram is the named
  follow-up (the τ-identity shows the naive two-functional coordinates have rank 1).

## 2026-07-02 — B358: the seam, exactly certified — √−15 lives in the twisted quantum-pair sector (and provably not in the canonical one)

- **The escalation protocol ran as pre-declared** (higher precision → exact; second independent construction →
  two): the cross-session Par-inserted seam claim was rebuilt in EXACT Fraction arithmetic over `ℚ(ζ₆₀)`
  (`cyclo_engine.py`; the full `C[j][l] = tr(Par·W₁ʲW₂ˡ)` tables; exact Galois H-average; exact solve in
  `{1,√5,√−3,√−15}`).
- **The dichotomy (the result):** the **theta/Jacobi lift** (cross-session construction;
  `Par·W·Par⁻¹·W⁻¹ = X¹Z²`) carries `√−15` in **44/49** nonzero doubles — exact small rationals; flagship
  `tr(Par·P₀Q₄) → −1/48 −(1/80)√5 −(1/48)√−3 +(1/48)√−15`, certified coefficient-for-coefficient at the
  claimed label. The **canonical lift** (B355; `Par` commutes with the image) has **`s ≡ 0` exactly on all
  doubles**. Single-seed controls: `r = s = 0` exactly, both lifts. The exact table also settles the
  height-blocked 217 from the cross-session run.
- **Meaning (honest form):** after five closed channels, `√−15` appears **exactly, and only, in the
  Heisenberg-twisted sector of the two-seed pairing** — the seam coefficient is a function of the lift's
  theta-characteristic. **L57 registered:** is the characteristic *forced* by the pairing geometry (theta
  structures / gluing frame), or a choice? Nothing promoted either way; field-membership statement, not
  physics.

## 2026-07-02 — B359: the seam form — pair-specific and parity-selective, exactly

- **Three exact paths to the flagship first:** the cross-session symbolic certificate (integer vectors mod
  `Φ₆₀`, Galois-norm inversion) was run on this machine and **PASSES** — `s = 1/48` exactly — joining B358's
  two independent exact computations.
- **The seam form (the L57 opener, run the day it was proposed):** extending B358's engine to seed 3, both
  lifts, all exact: **(1,3) golden×bronze is seam-DARK** (0 of 39 doubles, exactly); **(2,3) silver×bronze is
  bright with its own disjoint value set** `s ∈ {±1/144, ±1/288}` (the bronze pair's denominators carry `3²`);
  the canonical lift is 0 everywhere (the dichotomy control, again). So the twisted-sector seam data is
  **pair-specific** — and **selective**: both bright pairs contain the even seed; the odd–odd pair is dark —
  the parity texture (B354/B356) surfacing at the seam level. **Observed pattern (3 points), with the
  pre-registered prediction: (1,4) bright, (3,5) dark.**
- Committed exact artifact (regenerable; OA_SLOW regeneration lock); B358's guards cover the shared engine.
  L57 (is the characteristic forced?) remains the governing question; nothing promotes.

## 2026-07-02 — B360: the selection rule, tested — both parity readings die; silver-selectivity survives

- **The pre-registered B359 predictions ran (exact, theta lift): (3,5) DARK ✓ — but (1,4) DARK ✗** (the
  "contains an even seed" reading refuted) **and (2,4) BRIGHT** (36/49; `s ∈ {±1/120,±1/240,±1/480}` — the
  "opposite parity" reading refuted too). Three points did not make a law; the declared test killed both
  readings in one run.
- **Surviving rule (6 pairs, exact): bright ⇔ the pair contains silver (m=2)** — the unique seed among 1–5
  that is **regular-elliptic at 5 and nontrivial at 3** (`disc(A_m) = m⁴+4m² ≡ 0 mod 5` for m∈{1,4,5};
  `3|m` trivializes m=3). Two hypotheses separate — H-min (the `A₂` residue class specifically) vs H-loc
  (any 5-elliptic ∧ 3-nontrivial seed) — with the **pre-registered discriminator: pair (1,7)** (m=7 qualifies
  under H-loc): bright ⇒ H-loc, dark ⇒ H-min.
- New exact data: (2,4)'s `s`-set is a subset of (1,2)'s denominators (no new primes), unlike (2,3)'s
  bronze-`3²` values — the value-map (pair ↦ s-set) keeps accumulating structure for the post-L57 pass.

## 2026-07-02 — B361: the seam's local law — the discriminator decides H-loc

- **(1,7): BRIGHT** (20/31, `s ∈ {±1/48, ±1/96}`) ⇒ H-min (literal contains-2) **refuted**; **(3,7): BRIGHT**
  with the **value-echo** — its `s`-set is *identical* to (2,3)'s (`{±1/144, ±1/288}`).
- **The law (8 pairs, exact, zero counterexamples): the Par-inserted pair invariant carries `√−15` iff the
  pair contains a seed elliptic at both primes** (char poly irreducible mod 3 and mod 5; m = 2, 7 qualify;
  m = 1, 4 are 5-parabolic, m = 3 is 3-trivial, m = 5 is 5-trivial). The shape is exactly natural for
  `√−15 = √−3·√5` — one seed carrying both primes' quadratic data — **and the single-seed controls stay
  exactly clean: the key needs the lock; multiplicity remains essential.**
- The value-map (pair ↦ s-set) is finer than partner-only ((1,7) ≠ (1,2) sets but (3,7) = (2,3)) — real
  structure registered for the post-L57 pass. Next cheap discriminators pre-registered: (2,7) bright,

## 2026-07-02 — B362 + B363: the law at 11 pairs; the seam's lift anatomy — two-sided and class-bound

- **B362 (EXACT): three pre-registered predictions, three hits** — (2,7) BRIGHT (12/17, `s`-set = (1,7)'s),
  (1,5) DARK, (4,5) DARK. **The local law stands at 11 exact pairs, zero counterexamples:** bright ⇔ the pair
  contains a doubly-elliptic seed (m ∈ {2,7} among m ≤ 7).
- **B363 (the L57 opener):** the seam as a function on the lift torus. Verdicts: canonical×canonical dark in
  **both frames**; **all 225 one-sided Heisenberg twists dark**; **theta×canonical dark in either slot
  order**. With the exact bright theta×theta side: **the seam is TWO-SIDED — it requires the theta class in
  BOTH slots** (bilinear in the characteristic — the lift-sector echo of `√−15 = √−3·√5` and of the
  multiplicity theme). The **Par-lemma** (one line): Par-commuting lifts force real Par-traces ⇒ `s ≡ 0` —
  non-commutation is *necessary*; the scan shows it is *not sufficient*. The theta lift is not a Heisenberg
  twist of the canonical lift — it lives over the non-square quadratic-character class (`c = 2⁻¹ ≡ 8 mod 15`).
- **L57, restated sharply:** does the two-seed pairing geometry force the theta class on both slots
  simultaneously? (A theta structure on the *gluing* torus would decorate both boundary restrictions at once —
  the encouraging shape.) Analytic step, not a scan; now the program's sharpest open question.

## 2026-07-02 — B364: the two lifts are two polarizations — L57 becomes a spin-structure question

- **Tested:** is the theta lift *the* geometric lift (the level-15 theta-transformation action)? **T-side:**
  the triangular family (`E = n(n−1)/30`) is T-stable with **exactly the theta lift's multiplier** (analytic
  identity + `6e-15`). **The control killed the conclusion:** the square family (`n²/15`) is *also* T-stable
  with **exactly the canonical multiplier** (`8e-15`) — both classes arise as theta families; T-stability
  forces nothing.
- **L57 sharpened to polarization form:** the two lift classes = two polarizations (half-characteristic/odd
  `(2n−1)²/120` vs integral `n²/15`); *which does the two-seed gluing induce on the shared fiber's theta
  bundle?* **Named candidate (conjecture): the puncture's odd spin structure selects the half-characteristic**
  — one bundle, one lift map, both monodromies ⇒ the theta class forced on both slots at once (exactly B363's
  measured two-sidedness). Honest gap: the S-side identification (Poisson shows half-characteristic `ζ₃₀`
  data; not completed).

## 2026-07-02 — Wave 2 (the probation campaign) registered

The post-seam queue: W2.1/W2.2 the L57 endgame (S-side identification + the odd-spin argument — the seam arc's
probation gate); W2.3 the value-map `s(m₁,m₂)` (pre-registered local-symbol functional form); W2.4 the
cover-tower pairing (`tr(A₁³)=18` ⇒ the golden 3-fold cover IS the m=4 seed — the seam × generation-deck
question made computable); W2.5 dynamics (L53 + depth-2 Gram); W2.6 the cyclic-dilog bridge (seam data →
Kashaev `q=ζ₁₅` partition-function shadow — the values-meet-dynamics candidate); W2.7 sweepers; W2.8 the owner
outreach + a firewalled gravity reconnaissance. All two-outcome; everything on probation pending L57.

## 2026-07-03 — B365 (W2.1): S-closure fails for both (the metaplectic doubling); the vanishing signature discriminates

- **My pre-registered closure prediction was REFUTED by its own test** (both families' S-projection residuals
  ≈ 0.63): the corrected Poisson algebra shows the half-shift `(−1)^m` twist — **at odd level the S-transform
  forces the level-30 metaplectic doubling for BOTH polarizations**; the two 15-dim lifts are graded slices of
  the level-30 theta space. Selection does not happen at the S-closure level. (The campaign's second
  self-refuted prediction; both redirected the question productively.)
- **The surviving discriminator — the half-period vanishing signature:** the **triangular** family vanishes at
  **exactly one** half-period (`z = 1/2`, one basis function, exact at `3.3e-21`) and nowhere else; the
  **square** family vanishes at **all four** half-periods. Single-distinguished-point = the odd-theta
  signature — and the once-punctured fiber has exactly one marked point. **W2.2 sharpened to a concrete
  identification: the puncture's position in the fiber quantization ↔ the `z = 1/2` point of the triangular
  polarization.** The seam arc remains on probation pending that argument.

## 2026-07-03 — B366 (first installment): the invariant spin sector lives in the seam-bearing class

- **Two exact lemmas:** (1) `SL(2,ℤ)` fixes only the origin among the fiber's 2-torsion (the puncture = the
  unique invariant point; the three half-periods one orbit); (2) the odd characteristic `[½,½]` is the unique
  invariant spin structure (both generators fix it; the three evens form one orbit).
- **With the B364/B365 identification** (`T+=[½,0]` — its B364 T-multiplier independently matches `T` fixing
  `[½,0]`; `T−=[½,½]`; `S+=[0,0]`; `S−=[0,½]`): **the seam-bearing (a=½) class contains the unique invariant
  spin sector; the canonical (a=0) class contains none.** The gate's forcing argument has its exact skeleton:
  an MCG-equivariant single-sector quantization of the punctured fiber can only use the invariant sector.
- **Pre-registered, not yet passed:** the classical S-mixing prediction `T−→T−, S+→S+, T+↔S−` — three quick
  numerical ansatz attempts failed for three recorded reasons (degenerate strip; mis-derived prefactor;
  conflated growth measurement); the derivation-first S-transformation redo is the named next step. **The
  seam arc remains ON PROBATION until it passes.**

Locks: `tests/test_b366_invariant_spin_sector.py` (3, exact, <1 s). Zero promotions; firewall intact.

## 2026-07-03 — B366 part 2: the derived S-transformation — the closure dichotomy (W2.2 verdict)

- **The pre-registered naive S-mixing pattern FAILED** (`T−→T−, S+→S+, T+↔S−` is NOT how the geometric `S`
  acts at level 15) — the 4th failed-and-sharpened prediction of the arc; superseded by the derivation.
- **Two exact closed formulas** (one Jacobi inversion each; `j`-dependence cancels identically in both
  prefactors): the **triangular family is S-closed at fixed τ** — image = same family at `z + (τ+1)/30`
  (a 30-torsion Heisenberg translation), `ζ₃₀` kernel, prefactor `e((30z+1)²/120τ)`; the **square family
  exits** — image at `(z/2, τ/4)` (a rescaling, not a Heisenberg operation; B365's doubling from the S side).
  Verified 7.1e−12 / 1.2e−10, twist-shift identity 1.1e−15, half-K stable; no fits, no free parameters.
- **The gate's verdict, premise named:** within the standing premise (pair states = level-15 fiber theta
  functions with the standard Heisenberg/metaplectic action), a modular quantization needs `S` to act on the
  state space at the given modulus — only the seam-bearing class has that; part 1's invariant-spin selector
  agrees. **The theta lift is forced at this tier; the seam form is an invariant of the quantized pair.**
  The premise stays a named modeling assumption; nothing promotes.

Locks: `tests/test_b366_s_transformation.py` (3, <1 s). W2.2 RESOLVED; next: W2.3 (the value-map).

## 2026-07-03 — W2.4/B368 premise corrected (verified): equal trace ≠ same seed

- The queue row's premise (`tr(A₁³) = 18 = 4²+2` ⇒ the golden 3-fold fiber cover IS the m=4 seed) is
  **refuted by exact integer arithmetic** (cross-checked in-sandbox): fixed-point binary forms
  `(RL)³ → (8,−8,−8)`, content 8, primitive disc **5**; `R⁴L⁴ → (4,−16,−4)`, content 4, primitive disc
  **20**. Primitive discriminants are conjugacy invariants ⇒ not conjugate. The genuine cover tower is
  `(RL)^k` (disc 5, unit powers) — a different column from the metallic family (disc `m²(m²+4)`).
- B368 re-scoped accordingly in `OPEN_LEADS` (W2.4); equal-trace-different-seam is an independent
  finer-than-spectrum instance for the ledger.

## 2026-07-03 — B367 (W2.3) step 0: the exact six-pair s-matrices — every pre-registered check passed

- Pre-registration committed BEFORE computing (PR #442). Fresh theta-lift Weil matrices (W_m = WR^m·D^m,
  ℚ(ζ₆₀) engine), all six pair s-matrices **fully identified exactly** (no PSLQ). Gates: orders
  (20,12,6,20), projector sums/idempotence exact, single-seed controls clean, **all row/col sums exactly 0**.
- **Reconciliation complete — three independent computations now agree on every comparable entry:** the 8
  relayed (1,2) entries exact (S0.2); the relayed 11×11 (1,2) matrix reproduces entry-by-entry with its
  structure now exact — **rank 4, Coxeter-odd, {4,8}-sector = rows {0,4} disjoint** (S0.6); the (2,3)
  ±1/144 entries exact AND **the pre-registered ±1/288 prediction HIT** (the height-blocked entries; S0.3);
  the (1,3)/(1,4) zeros upgrade to **exact tier** (S0.4); first complete (2,4)/(3,4) tables — value sets
  {±1/120,±1/240,±1/480} and {±1/48,±1/96} (S0.5).
- **Exact aggregates Σs² (supersede all partial values): 43/7200 · 1/192 · 3/3200 · 1/2304 · 0 · 0**
  ((1,2) > (3,4) > (2,4) > (2,3) > the two exact zeros). V1 denominator hypothesis holds on all data
  (2^a·3^b·5^c, a≤5, b≤2, c≤1).
- Locks: `tests/test_b367_step0.py` (5 always-on + 1 OA_SLOW regen). The V3 local-symbol search + null +
  held-outs run NEXT, exactly as pre-registered — no formula claim is licensed by step 0.

## 2026-07-03 — B367 step 0 (continued): the completed table REFUTES the B361 local law at pair (3,4)

- (3,4) is **bright** ({±1/48, ±1/96}, Σs² = 1/192, second-largest) with **no seed elliptic at both
  primes** — the banked "bright ⇔ a both-elliptic seed" rule (11 pairs) dies on the twelfth pair. The
  covering repair dies on (1,3) (identical covering pattern, exactly dark). W₁/W₄ have identical level-15
  spectra ⇒ **support is strictly finer than spectra + ellipticity types.** Two independent computations
  agree on (3,4). B361's row updated; its confirming pairs remain valid data.

## 2026-07-03 — suite hygiene note (pre-existing, tracked): one intermittent flake per full run

- Two consecutive full runs each showed ONE failing test, a DIFFERENT one each time (b207 volumes
  monotonicity, then b137 m=2 sealing) — both pass standalone and in targeted groups, both untouched by the
  merged diffs (which were additive). Reads as load/ordering sensitivity (SnapPy retriangulation randomness
  / sympy cache pressure), not mathematics. Tracked as a hygiene item; targeted verification (both flaked
  tests + all diff-adjacent locks: 21 passed) gates the current merge.

## 2026-07-03 — B367 (W2.3) COMPLETE: the V3 verdict is outcome (B) — the value map is not CRT-local

- The pre-registered model (`s = X3[3-local] · X5[5-local] · X4[4-part]`, exact multiplicative tensor
  completion) **fails on the true data; 0/200 matched random tables pass** (the test has teeth). Diagnosis,
  exact and graded: (2,4) and (2,3) factor individually; **(1,2) (rank 4) and (3,4) (the law-breaker) do
  not**; every two-pair joint is inconsistent (even (2,3)+(2,4), sharing seed 2). Ranks: 4, 2, 1, 2 —
  rank alone does not decide factorability.
- **Probe conclusion: neither the support (the refuted law) nor the values (V3) factor through
  (m mod 3, m mod 5, CRT labels)** — the seam form is an eigenbasis-geometry invariant in a strong sense.
  Per the pre-registration the lead closes at this complexity (open at higher complexity, not
  "impossible"); the exact six-pair table is the banked exhibit. Any finer-input model (fixed-point form
  discs; Galois-cocycle data) requires a NEW pre-registration before computing.
- Locks: +1 (the V3 verdict + graded diagnosis). W2.3 CLOSED; queue advances (B368 corrected scope, W2.9
  concatenation-kill, W2.5).

## 2026-07-03 — B369 (W2.9) DONE: concatenation kills the seam (prediction hit) + the rotation-Galois identity

- **The registered prediction HIT, 6/6**: every two-block word `R^{m₁}L^{m₁}R^{m₂}L^{m₂}` tested
  ((1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(2,3),(3,4),(1,4)) is **seam-null** — zero √−3/√−15 in every eigenprojector readout,
  exactly. Sharpest instance: the (3,4) word is clean while the (3,4) PAIR is bright at Σs² = 1/192. **The
  seam lives in the unglued pair relation; gluing the same blocks into one monodromy kills it.** The
  single-object wall extends to these first non-seed single objects (word orders 4,4,20,20,4,10).
- **One design-error gate, diagnosed into a finding**: the naive rotated-word multiset gate failed because
  it tested a non-invariant (the readout is (lift,Par)-sector data; Par-conjugation = the X¹Z² Heisenberg
  twist). The exact structure: **rotation acts by the √5-Galois involution, exponent-wise:
  r₍₂,₁₎(a) = σ(r₍₁,₂₎(a))**. Same manifold, lift moved by Heisenberg, arithmetic moved by Galois.
- Locks: `tests/test_b369_concat_kill.py` (4, exact, <1 s). The June word-trace lead fully resolved.

## 2026-07-03 — B368 (W2.4, corrected scope) DONE: the seam sees the deck equivariantly

- **The deck identity, exact (all 240 cells):** `t_cover(a,b) = t_base(7a mod 20, b)` — the (RL)³ cover's
  pairing against m=2 is the base (1,2) pairing relabeled by the deck's exponent action `a↦3a` (forced by
  `P_a(W₁³)=P_{7a}(W₁)`, gcd(3,20)=1; verified against the banked B367 table). **Covers create no new seam
  content against a fixed partner; the form is ψ³-equivariant, not blind.**
- Cover exponent list = `3·K1 mod 20 = {0,2,3,5,7,8,12,13,15,17,18}` — the relayed cross-session list now
  verified. Tower singles `W₁^k` (k=2..5) all clean — the wall extends up the tower.
- **Trace-18 twins split at the seam:** the cover pair carries the base's 14 values (±1/48…±1/480); the
  m=4 seed pair carries {±1/120,±1/240,±1/480} — equal trace, equal lift order, different seam forms.
- Gate-C reading (firewalled): a ℤ/3 deck does not manufacture seam-distinct generation sectors — the
  sheets carry relabeled copies of one form. Locks: `tests/test_b368_cover_tower.py` (4, exact).

## 2026-07-03 — W2.8 prep: the outreach package upgraded (Brief S added)

- `frontier/EXPERT_OUTREACH.md`: **Brief S (new, the lead exhibit)** — the pair-level Weil invariant
  (the seam law) as a bounded prior-art question for a modular-data/Weil-representation specialist
  (type-matches named with verify flags; Deloup–Turaev reciprocity flagged as the closest known
  neighborhood). Gates B and C "what we supply" upgraded in place (the exact 𝔢₆, the certified boundary
  Lagrangian + universal-τ; the ψ³ deck equivariance + the chirality window). Sequencing updated: Brief S
  first. **Sending remains the owner's action**; log sends/replies here.

## 2026-07-03 — W2.5 opened: B370 pre-registration committed (third-order Massey + depth-2 Gram)

- `frontier/B370_massey_depth2/PREREGISTRATION.md`: leg A = the third-order Maurer–Cartan obstruction
  per exponent direction (the order-3 Fox/BCH relator expansion DERIVED SYMBOLICALLY FIRST — the B366
  lesson — validated on the m=1 integrable control before any verdict; Massey class read modulo its
  indeterminacy with an MB12 transverse-pairing control); leg B = the depth-2 boundary Gram against
  unchanged B357 conventions with three declared readouts (symmetry / τ-persistence / θ-blocks). Both
  legs two-outcome; completes the Gate-B classical-germ package. Execution next session (fresh context
  for the derivation; machinery = B352's two-basis architecture, dps 100).

## 2026-07-03 — W2.8/L51 set DORMANT (owner directive): compute first, outreach only at exhaustion

- Owner directive (reaffirming the standing compute-first rule): **no external contact of any kind until
  the in-sandbox computational paths are exhausted.** The outreach briefs (incl. Brief S) remain banked as
  preparation artifacts only; nothing has been sent, and nothing will be without the owner's explicit
  decision at the exhaustion point. The live queue is computational: B370 execution, the level-45
  sweeper, the (1,3)/(3,4) discriminator, the finer-input value-map re-registration.

## 2026-07-03 — GOVERNANCE amendment: the promotion-audit lane + automated gates + the decadal review

**Rationale (owner-approved; §10-compliant — additive discipline, no rule weakened):** Phase B ran with
the §5 promotion gates idle ("zero promotions" was practice, not law), leaving `CLAIMS.md`
unrepresentative of the project's load-bearing exact results and creating an epistemic asymmetry
(refutations bank decisively; positives could never graduate). The staging principle (§6.2 — verification
attaches at promotion) was designed expecting promotions to fire; they never did. Instituted:

- **§5.1** — the mathematics lane (eligibility is independent of physics readings; the framing lock
  governs interpretation, never eligibility) + the **Certified data** ledger section (`E`-ids) + the
  **promotion audit** (periodic §5-bar sweep of `frontier/`; promotions only through the gates, logged).
  The celebrated metric changes: not "zero promotions" but "promotions with zero unmarked retractions."
- **§11** — automated gates (`scripts/gates/gates.py`, suite-locked by `tests/test_repo_gates.py`;
  7 gates green at institution: framing lock, claims integrity, one-way firewall, append-only log,
  atlas freshness, attribution, forbidden artifacts) + the **decadal review** (every ~10 merges;
  ledger `docs/progress/REVIEWS.md`, seeded with Review 0 at this commit's anchor).
- Propagated: `CLAIMS.md` header + Certified-data section; `ARCHITECTURE.md` ledger row; `README.md`
  zero-promotions lines. The physics firewall, the one-way room rule, HELD, and every §5/§6 bar are
  untouched. The promotion audit itself is registered in `OPEN_LEADS` as a dedicated session.

## 2026-07-03 — the promotion-audit sweep (collection stage) COMPLETE

- Four parallel strict sweeps over frontier/B1–B369 FINDINGS (instruction: when in doubt, NOT).
  **Yield: 63 candidates** — 33 PROVEN-tier, 7 CONDITIONAL-tier, 20 DATA-tier (E-ids), 3
  adjudicate-tier (dps-100 computer-assisted) — of ~350 probes; 297 NOT with recorded reasons.
- Compiler flags for adjudication: B368/B369 mis-triaged NOT (pre-reform stamps read literally —
  re-read); B263 has no FINDINGS (hygiene); correction-chain candidates (B112, B131, B92/B95/B153,
  B134/B136, B204) adjudicated with their qualifications; B370 classified when leg A banks.
- Worksheet: `audit/PROMOTION_AUDIT_WORKSHEET.md` (private audit room; iCloud-synced). The
  adjudication session (task #167) re-reads every candidate, runs §6, verifies locks, writes scoped
  statements, and promotes survivors in ONE reviewed PR. Bar, never importance (owner-confirmed).

## 2026-07-03 — B370 leg A DONE: all six E₆ tangent directions unobstructed at THIRD order

- Jet-arithmetic method (no BCH transcription; self-gating P₁/P₂/P₃), dps 100, 2.9 h. Controls:
  coboundary class 6.2e−87 (exact tier), the integrable m=1 control 9.6e−62 (floor). **Every
  direction's third-order class sits 5–10 orders below its own P-gates** — m=4: 8.5e−63, m=5:
  3.8e−61, m=7: 1.2e−55, m=8: 3.1e−54, m=11: 1.1e−48 (floors grow with the Sym-block range, the
  B352 pattern). MB12 non-vacuous on every nontrivial indeterminacy span (ranks 0,1,1,3,4,4).
- **The 6-dim local moduli's integrability evidence reaches order 3, escape sector included.**
  Honest tier: computer-assisted; order 4+ untested; leg B (depth-2 boundary Gram) runs next.
- Locks: `tests/test_b370_massey.py` (4, from the banked JSON). Pre-registration honored end-to-end.

## 2026-07-03 — B370 leg B: two gate-blocked runs, bug localized (no verdicts read)

- The pre-registered first-order τ-gate stopped both leg-B executions (τ spread 3e+04 vs the banked
  uniform −2√3·i) — the depth-2 readouts were never interpreted. Isolation test localizes the bug to
  the root→TG bridge: B352's chain basis relates to TG's symrep basis by the **antidiagonal
  intertwiners** (`_intertwiner(m)`), not a diagonal rescale. Fix identified (compose the bridge with
  the intertwiner); the m=1 τ-gate is the acceptance test. δ = φ_λ − τ·φ_µ stays the right invariant.
- Method note: the gate design paid for itself twice — two O(1) "defect matrices" were produced and
  correctly discarded as convention artifacts before any interpretation.

## 2026-07-03 — B370 leg B DONE (W2.5 COMPLETE): the universal-τ is strictly first-order, and the
## depth-2 bending is θ-graded

- The τ-gate certified the pipeline on the third run (the fix: compose the root→TG bridge with B352's
  antidiagonal intertwiners): **τ = −2√3·i uniform across all six directions, spread 1.4e−63**;
  off-diagonals at floor. Two earlier O(1) "defect matrices" were gate-rejected as convention
  artifacts — never interpreted.
- **Verdicts (relative to per-entry φ-scale):** (1) δ ≢ 0 at relative scale 1.017 — **the universal-τ
  does not persist at depth 2**; B357's identity is an order-1 rigidity, now sharply bounded.
  (2) **θ-graded bending**: F₄-target blocks saturate (0.99–1.00) while escape-sector targets are
  ~3× suppressed (0.33) — the depth-2 germ sees the E₆→F₄ fold. (3) Mixed symmetry (data).
- **W2.5 COMPLETE ⇒ the Gate-B classical germ is complete**: orders 1–3 integrable + Lagrangian +
  universal-τ (order 1) + the depth-2 τ-defect matrix with its θ-grading. +1 lock (leg B gates+verdicts).

## 2026-07-03 — THE PROMOTION AUDIT EXECUTED: 61 entries promoted (P17–P55, C6–C12, E1–E15); 6 held

**Protocol applied uniformly per candidate** (GOVERNANCE §5/§5.1/§6): FINDINGS re-read; the five
red-team questions answered; the test lock verified standalone (281 tests across five batches: 24 +
61 + 69 + 90 + 37); the independent-second-path leg checked; a scoped statement written; label
assigned by the bar, never importance (owner directive). Sweep provenance: four parallel strict
triage passes over frontier/B1–B369 (63 candidates of ~350 probes; 297 NOT with recorded reasons).

**Promoted: 39 proven (P17–P55), 7 conditional (C6–C12, each with its premise in the statement),
15 certified-data (E1–E15).** Scoping decisions of record: B112 promotes ONLY its Tier-1 lemma (its
own relabel warning governs); B90 promotes ONLY L1b (tautology + refuted mechanism excluded); B153
excludes the numerical non-semisimple leg; B134/B136 are corollaries of the published GHH-2008
criterion (cited) + exhaustive certificates; B204 cites the Jeffrey-1992 framework (novelty not
claimed); B65+B80 and B273+B274 each merge into ONE claim with two independent evidence paths;
B131 is scoped to its exact (1,2) fork; B211/B240 promote data with novelty explicitly not claimed.

**Held, with reasons: 6.** B63 (subsumed by P22's two-path claim); B196 (identities subsumed by E6;
placement NEEDS-SPECIALIST); B352/B353/B357/B370 (the dps-100 computer-assisted class — their own
FINDINGS describe evidence-not-proof; a future "exact-core extraction" pass is the named route).

The proven core P1–P16 is untouched; the physics firewall is untouched; every O-target remains
open; nothing physics-adjacent moved. The ledger now represents what the project knows, at the
strength it knows it. (New metric in force: promotions with zero unmarked retractions.)

## 2026-07-03 — B371: the minimal two-state sector — verified, banked, promoted (P56, P57)

- A relayed cross-session probe (pre-registered there before computation, with kill conditions and an
  honest errors ledger) answered the owner's "can we compute a photon?" with **NO at the physics level**
  and a well-posed slot question at the math level. **Independently re-verified here from scratch,
  every claim exact** (`slot_verification.py`): the 2-dim invariant sector, global dihedral relation,
  helicity pairing ±ζ₆₀⁹, pentagon-angle golden action (1−φ exactly), the true parity J = Ŝ²
  (monomial j→1−j, commutes exactly), the Weyl identity J·Par = ζ₆⁻¹·X·Z, and the seam self-coupling
  at ±1/48 on exactly {6,14}×{2,10}. The value stratification of the (1,2) table = the prime-3 parity
  split (rigid rows {0,4,6,14} + silent 16 = the trivial-at-3 tower).
- **Promoted at banking (§5.1 steady state): P56 (the sector), P57 (the parity + Weyl identities)** —
  exact, locked (4 tests), two independent computation paths. FIREWALL intact: a photon-shaped slot
  is not a photon; no physics noun earned.
- **Registered open (fresh pre-registration required): the row-16 silence** — no forcing law survives
  the exact data (three involutions killed); localized to the XZ block-diagonal on the 3-dim block;
  the selection-rule derivation of ±1/48 as the unique allowed sector↔sector XZ element is the target.

## 2026-07-03 — B372 (W2.7) DONE: the seam is a LEVEL-FAMILY phenomenon (null refuted); E16

- CRT/F_p engine (toolbox row 6), gate-anchored on the banked level-15 flagship (exact
  reproduction), 3 primes, held-out embeddings, zero identification failures.
- **Q1 (the wall): HOLDS, cleaner than at 15** — singles = four cells ≡ 1 mod 15, each exactly 1/4,
  purely rational. **Q2: the pre-registered null REFUTED** (the arc's 5th productive failure):
  **all 144 pair cells carry imaginary components; 144/144 carry √−15-type content; every cell has
  genuine ℚ(ζ₉)⁺ dependence** — the seam persists at 45 and its home GROWS to the 12-dim compositum.
  Denominators stay 15-smooth × 2-power (≤ 2880).
- E16 promoted at banking (the exact table; certified data). Follow-on lead registered: the value
  tower's growth with the level (the conductor structure of the seam). Task #161 completed.

## 2026-07-03 — B373 (PD1.1) the kill test: MOVED — gapless-trending; the relayed bet loses; E17

- **Exactly one invariant two-state sector at level 45: exponents {6,54}** — the exponent pinned at
  ±6 while ord grows (20 → 60), so the quasi-energy moved 108° → 36° (= 108/3) with
  `tr ρ(A₁) = φ` exactly (2cos 36°). Silver pinned at 60° (seed-dependent — data). Helicity and the
  global dihedral relation persist. The pre-registered MOVED outcome hit verbatim; the independent
  "pinned/anyon-shaped" bet is the refuted branch at this rung.
- **The tower door (PD2.2) is ALIVE**: phase ~ 9π/N → 0. Pre-registered for level 135 BEFORE
  computing: unique sector at ±6 of ord 180 (±12°, trace 2cos 12°), pairing + dihedral persist.
- E17 promoted at banking. The priced-doors campaign's first verdict: the mass-word's costume moves
  from "possibly anyon" to "lattice-artifact phase, gapless-trending" — still zero physics nouns earned.

## 2026-07-03 — B374 (rung 3): the pinned-exponent law REFUTED — the pentagon-pair oscillation

- Level 135: **the unique invariant sector is {54, 126} — phase ±108° again** (ord 180; dihedral
  global; cross-prime confirmed). B373's registered kill fired: the "gapless-trending, 9π/N" reading
  is dead at rung three (the sixth productive failure). The exact three-rung law: phase pinned to the
  pentagon pair {36°, 108°}, alternating with the 3-adic parity of N = 15·3^k; traces alternate
  1−φ / φ / 1−φ. The mass-word reading returns to anyon-shaped on this tower; the gapless hinge is
  CLOSED along 15·3^k as measured.
- **E17's extrapolation clause corrected in place** (marked, logged; the level-45 data stands).
- Pre-registered before computation: level 75 (5-tower) — pentagon-pair membership (weak form);
  level 405 — alternation continues (36°). B373's FINDINGS carries the refutation cross-reference.

## 2026-07-03 — the 75-rung (5-tower): the pentagon-pair prediction also killed — phase 90°, trace 0

- Unique sector {25, 75} of ord 100: **±90°, golden trace exactly 0** (quarter-turn). Seventh
  productive failure. Four exact rungs: phases 108/36/108/90; a/N = 2/5, 2/15, 2/5, 1/3; ord = 4N/3
  uniform. **The surviving law: existence + uniqueness of the invariant two-state sector at every
  level tested (two tower directions), with helicity and ord = 4N/3.** The phase-map riddle
  registered (3-part/5-part arithmetic of N); next datum N = 225, NO phase prediction registered.

## 2026-07-03 — B375 (PD1.3): the four-qubit compilation + the exact protocol theorem (P58)

- The algebra generated by TWO primitives (exact diagonal + exactly-unitary DFT ⊕ 1); WR̂ from the
  primitives equals the banked generator as an identity; the 240-word Hadamard-test protocol with the
  declared weights reproduces the banked seam cells EXACTLY (flagship + the minimal-sector's ±1/48).
  The κ-word's Weil trace is exactly 1. P58 promoted at banking (exact + locked).
- The κ-letter deliverable's in-sandbox half is complete: ±1/48 as an instrument reading, in exact
  arithmetic. Hardware = owner decision (out of campaign scope); feasibility honestly estimated in
  CIRCUIT.md (~10⁶ shots/word to resolve 1/48; synthesis depth = the engineering question). The
  letter/spirit firewall stated and governing.

## 2026-07-03 — N=225: NO invariant sector — the existence law dies at the first mixed level

- ord = 300 = 4N/3 ✓; sixteen mult-1 pairs; **zero invariant** (cross-prime). Eighth registered
  kill. Five-rung law in m = N/15: sectors at prime-power m (1, 3, 5, 9), none at m = 15 = 3·5.
  **The minimal sector lives on prime-power towers only.** Refined preregs committed: 405 exists
  (36°), 375 exists, 675 none. The tower/continuum reading must survive sector-death at mixed levels.

## 2026-07-03 — the Recognition campaign registered (PR #466) + R1 first pass: the classics miss

- Phase 0 delivered: the Constraint Document (C-1…C-12) — every exact fact a candidate generating
  theory must reproduce. Four recognition sweeps pre-registered with kills.
- R1 first pass: **Rademacher Φ(A_m) ≡ 3 across the metallic family** (new exact datum; constant ⇒
  killed as the phase generator); Dedekind s(1,m) killed by the affine criterion. The level-indexed
  zoo (Weil/Maslov index of the A₁-action at level N; η-quotient multipliers) is the registered
  continuation.

## 2026-07-03 — B376 (R1): RECOGNITION HIT — the tower is the quantized golden cat map (P59)

- **π(N)/2 = ord(A₁ mod N) = the measured Weil order at ALL FIVE levels** including the sector-less
  225. "ord = 4N/3" was coincidental; the Pisano identity is structural. Predictions registered:
  500/540/900 at N = 375/405/675.
- The frame (Hannay–Berry; Kurlberg–Rudnick Hecke theory) is KNOWN mathematics — cited, not claimed.
  What it buys: the phase-map riddle → cat-map doublet eigenvalues; the prime-power existence law →
  ℤ[φ]-splitting arithmetic (5 ramifies, 3 inert) with the R2 obstruction as character misalignment;
  **Phase 2's derive-don't-fit target fixed**: derive the existence law, a(N), and ultimately the
  C-5 seam tables from cat-map Hecke theory — breakthrough if it derives, sharpest boundary if not.

## 2026-07-03 — B377 (D0+D1): the existence law DERIVED; the 225 prediction HIT; three rung
## predictions registered (one REVERSED by our own 27-census)

- **D0:** the full-multiplicity census at 225 = NONE — the prediction registered while it ran, HIT.
- **The complete local table** (3,5,9,25,27,81,125 exact): doublets at ODD prime powers only
  (3-side 90°; ramified 5-side 36/108 by σ-class); lines always on the inert side, EVEN powers only
  on the ramified side. Tensor factorization verified with corrected multipliers ((2,2) at 15 —
  the relayed note's values were a parametrization offset, caught by our failed-then-fixed check).
- **The v2 law derives all six banked verdicts** incl. 75's 90° and the 225 death. Acceptance
  predictions registered BEFORE the rungs: **375 → 108°** (the 90° branch died with the missing
  125-line), **405 → 36°**, **675 → EXISTS at 90°** (REVERSING the naive "none" — the odd-power
  27-doublet flips it). Law promotion GATED on all three.
- Governance note of record: campaign and labor decided HERE; the relayed material entered as
  substance only, verified and corrected before any use.

## 2026-07-03 — B379 (D3(b) opener): the reduction theorem + closed form VERIFIED; P60; the
## W2.11 gap is now ONE number + ONE reality proof

- The relayed selection-rule hunt (owner-directed; pre-registered there before computation)
  verified item-by-item here: **T1 the reduction theorem, 13/13 cells component-exact** (both
  seats' first checkers independently hit and fixed the same real-subfield trap — cross-validating
  the machinery); **T2 the closed form exact**: the rigid sector = one constant with two Galois
  faces (−(φ/6)√−3 and its σ_√5 conjugate), so ±1/48 = ±(1/4)·(1/12); the Weyl form holds with J
  verified scalar on both blocks. The support pattern is now DERIVED. Their H2/H3 kills recorded.
- **Row 16 is ℚ(√5)-dark** (banked-data-exact; σ₄₉ pairs rows 4↔16). The remaining W2.11 gap:
  (1) derive the 1/12; (2) prove t(16,·) ∈ ℚ(√5). P60 promoted at banking.

## 2026-07-03 — the seam form's exact Gram spectrum: the doublet is a theorem; the prime 23 appears

- Relayed SVD observations verified by exact char poly: Gram spectrum = {1/576, 1/576, 1/768,
  23/19200} exactly (all rational; perfect-square discriminant; trace = the banked 43/7200).
  **1/576 = 1/24² is a double root** — the two strongest observables (escape vs the non-exponent
  {2,10} columns) are exactly degenerate at the Haar strength 1/24 = 1/|2T|. **23 is the first
  prime outside {2,3,5} in the program's exact values** — flagged, not interpreted. The relayed
  reciprocal-ratio claim did not reproduce as stated (returned for specification). C-5 constraints
  sharpened for D3(c); lock added.

## 2026-07-03/04 — B380: the Galois covariance laws verified (P61); the F₄ reciprocal duality
## confirmed after a wrong-object correction on the verifying side

- The relayed pre-registered census verified cell-exactly: **σ₃₁ is a proven symmetry of all six
  tables** (odd rows of (1,2) pair up — half redundant); **the mirror is conjugation**
  (t(a,−b) = τ₃(t(a,b)), full-vector — mirror-column reality now derived); the τ₃-relabel laws
  exact on four tables + the tower domain measured exactly (36 odd fails); √5-flippers fail
  everywhere (the P60 conjugacy is trace-level only); **(2,3) is stabilized by the entire
  √5-fixing half-group** (all 8 — verified).
- The earlier "returned" reciprocal-ratio claim: VERIFIED once the right object was specified
  (K2-columns 1,5): ratios {−4,−1/4}∪{−3/2,−2/3} reciprocal pairs; equal-norm F₄ Gram
  (49/115200; ⟨v₁,v₅⟩ = −13/57600) — reconciled with the banked canonical spectrum.
- Intake recorded (hints): 1/48 = Haar(2T×ℤ/2) = B₂/8; the McKay node map; the dilog-bridge
  negative. Residues ranked in FINDINGS (row-16 reality still the stubborn one). P61 promoted.

## 2026-07-04 — B381 (D2 COMPLETE): the seam is a twist invariant (P62)

- No intertwiner in the exhaustive natural family: the theta and canonical lifts are genuinely
  inequivalent — the half-characteristic twist (cocycle ζ₁₅^{−j(j+1)/2}, exhibited) is structure.
- The mechanism is a commutant fact: Par central in the canonical model (the B358 null = a
  corollary); Par−J = the Weyl step in the theta model. **seam ≠ 0 ⟺ the twist is carried.**
- The chain now closes: premise ⇒ twist forced (C6) ⇒ seam exists (P62) ⇒ support forced (P60)
  ⇒ symmetries forced (P61); the rigid sector's one remaining freedom = the 1/12. D2 ✅.

## 2026-07-04 — B382 leg 1: the phase-ratio law verified on its exact classical domain

- `tr(U·XᵃZᵇ) = tr(U)·ζ₁₅^{Q(a,b)}` with Q quadratic — exact on all 225 shifts for every sampled
  word with det(γ−I) invertible; the two non-invertible words fail as pure phases — **the domain
  boundary confirms itself**. The D-side intertwining is phase-free (DXD⁻¹ = XZ). Universal
  linear part (7a+8b) — the shift's own fingerprint. Legs 2–3 (ordering correction + the slot
  constant in closed form) named and pending.

## 2026-07-04 — B382 leg 2: the closed form; the twist IS the half-characteristic term

- tr(U·XᵃZᵇ) = tr(U)·ζ₁₅^{½ω(v,(γ−I)⁻¹v) − ½ab − ½ω(v,(1,1))} — all conventions pinned by the
  ten-face Cayley fit (α=2⁻¹, s=−2⁻¹). Registered cross-check PASSED: the canonical model gives
  the SAME quadratic+ordering with linear part (0,0) — the theta twist enters the trace formula
  as exactly one term, the half-characteristic −½ω(v,(1,1)) at the Weyl point. Leg 3: assemble
  the slot constant as the (1,1)-shifted DFT (o₁o₂=240 in view).

## 2026-07-04 — B382 leg 3: the assembly exact; THE 1/12 DECOMPOSES AS 1/16 + 1/48

- Gate A: 142/142 domain cells of the Par-table equal ζ₆⁻¹·χ·ζ₁₅^Q — the whole table IS the
  trace formula on its domain. Gate B: the slot constant reassembles exactly to (0,0,−1/12,−1/12).
- THE READING: det-class split = generic −1/16 + 5-boundary −1/48 (classes 3, 15 silent) — the
  1/12 is the Hannay–Berry generic sum plus one-third more from the golden-ramified cells.
  Mechanical-240 REFUTED as mechanism; Haar/B₂ remain numerological faces. Residue: derive
  −1/16, −1/48 from |tr|² = 15/|det| per class. Bonus: the banked 3-block face's grading
  identified as ±(P₄−P₀)⊗±(Q₈−Q₄); new exact face value ±1/24 for (P₄−P₁₆)⊗(Q₄−Q₈).

## 2026-07-04 — B383: the row-16 reality THEOREM (proved) + the ζ₅-spectrum mechanism

- t(16,b) ∈ ℚ(√5) for ALL b — finite exact verification (T1); the darkness is a zero of the
  anti-table's ζ₅-spectrum at exactly the 16-exponent (T2), distinguishing 16-dark from
  4-bright by character exponent alone (T3; new exact row-4 values banked). The P60 residue
  is closed: row-16 silence = reality theorem + mirror law.

## 2026-07-04 — B382 leg 4: the magnitude law |χ|² = #Fix(γ′) — unit on generic cells

- All 240 cells: |χ|² = the fixed-point count (1/9/5/25/45 by class) — the twist is pure
  phase; the −1/16 is a pure phase-sum identity (84 unit terms). Residue named: its CRT
  ζ₃×ζ₅ closed form. Per-cell class partials banked; they recombine to −1/16 / −1/48 exactly.

## 2026-07-04 — THE ACCEPTANCE DUEL: 3/3 — the v2 existence law PROMOTED (P63); D1 CLOSED

- 375: 108°/ord 500 ✓✓✓ · 405: 36°/ord 540 ✓✓✓ · 675: exists 90°/ord 900 ✓✓✓ — nine registered
  sub-verdicts, all correct, three phases distinguished by QR class. Root cause of the 405
  stall found and fixed (primes lacked ζ₈₁ — silent floor-division corruption; now ≡1 mod
  40500 + order cap). PROMOTIONS: P63 (v2 law), P64 (B382 trace formula + 1/16+1/48), P65
  (B383 row-16 theorem). B384 T1 landed: ⟨4₁⟩_N is NOT rational at general N — exact Galois
  components extracted; the √5-part is NONZERO at every 5|N level (2 at N=5; 2023/4 at 15;
  13100 at 25; 71150671/4 at 45; ~1.3e20 at 135): registered bet (b) PASSES — golden content
  in the Kashaev ladder at our levels. Scaling gate consistent (2π·log/N decreasing 4.93→2.36).

## 2026-07-04 — B384 T2: the tower transports the m=1 seed constant EXACTLY (1/4, identity)

- Coset 1 + (ord/4)ℤ at both 15 and 45, same value (1/4) — first exact cross-level constant
  equality (the level-45 companion step). m=2: same ord-12 grid + denominator family, extra
  basis components at 45 — relabel law OPEN. T3 (the (S,T) seam block) next; then D5.

## 2026-07-04 — B384 T3 + D5: the campaign wrap — D0–D5 COMPLETE

- T3: the slot's S-compression is TRIANGULAR (F(6,14)=0 exact) — NO-MATCH to 2-anyon/U(1)_k
  blocks at sector level; g(15) = √−15 (the seam radical normalizes S); twist diagonal
  h=(3/10,7/10); tr(F|slot) = −(5/16φ)(3−√−3). D5 synthesis written into RECOGNITION.md
  (6 derived, 5 resisted, residue queue priced); PRICED_DOORS PD1.2/PD3.1 rows updated.
  The Derivation Campaign's registered program is COMPLETE.

## 2026-07-04 — B385 T1: double kill — the bright/dark discriminator is character-level

- Kill 1: no γ-group invariant separates (bright (2,3) ≡ dark (1,3) profiles). Kill 2: the
  word-grid det-class distribution fails on exactly the riddle pair ((3,4) ≡ (1,3):
  {63,21,27,9}/120). DERIVED continuation: D·C⁻¹ = Z^{−8} exactly — theta words = standard
  lift × T(v_word); the discriminator must live in the accumulated word-shift map's 5-part.

## 2026-07-04 — B385 T2-partial: the v_word map separates the riddle pair (first layer that does)

- W-word = U_std(γ′)·T(v_word)·phase derived and sanity-locked; the 5-part support sets are
  disjoint bright-vs-dark; (3,4): 12 vectors vs (1,3): 18. Criterion extraction = next
  (property scan registered in FINDINGS).

## 2026-07-04 — B385 T2b: darkness is SPECTRUM-cancellation (dark (1,3) has 44/120 anti cells,
same as bright (3,4)) — the P65 mechanism at pair scale; 3 scan nulls; 4 bright-exclusive
joint labels on the riddle. Criterion open, true form named (window-cancellation identity).

## 2026-07-04 — B385 correction: the criterion draft KILLED by its own 12/12 test

- Two self-caught errors: the banked split is s-only (my T2b counts were z∨s — data true,
  reading corrected in place); and the Π_H/DFT commutation fallacy voided the translation-kill
  logic (third appearance of the trap this session). Continuation reframed: field-level
  quasi-periods C[j+dj,l+dl] = ζ₆₀^r·C[j,l], which commute with the DFT.

## 2026-07-04 — B385 T3 + staging: quasi-period ladders found ((1,5)/(4,5): 9 elements,
r = 36k twists, forcing support 6); presence doesn't separate. The criterion arc STAGED with
the honest ledger (one data-level separator, five nulls, one voided draft). Next: the CRT
closed form of −1/16 (P64 residue).

## 2026-07-04 — Closure Campaign W0 + W1/L1: visibility infra (PR #490) + the tensor identity

- W0: live status board (iCloud-mirrored) + the tier roadmap banked; reporting protocol on.
- B386 L1: C[j,l] = C₃·C₅ exactly (0/240) at (u₃,u₅)=(2,2); (1,1) fails 146/240 — the seam
  table tensor-splits; the 1/12 factorizes into 3-local × 5-local data. L2 next.

## 2026-07-04 — W1 COMPLETE (P66): the 1/12 in closed form, end-to-end

- B386 L2: the class partials assemble exactly as two-branch products of local sums (3-side
  ℤ₄×ℤ₄ table × 5-side parity-branch constants); −1/16 and −1/48 reproduced; golden-boundary
  couples equal parities only (off-parity branches ≡ 0). With L1 (tensor identity) the 1/12
  is derived from local data end-to-end. Promoted P66. W1 exited BANKED at time-box.

## 2026-07-04 — W2 2a/2b: the registered KILL — the seam and the value sector DECOUPLE at 45

- const(45) = 0 exactly (sector rows ±6 absent from the banked E16 support); ratio 0 ∉ R1-R4;
  gauntlet not triggered. The structural read: the coincidence of seam and value sector is a
  base-level (15) phenomenon. The 135 sector-row computation is running (named continuation).

## 2026-07-04 — W2 COMPLETE: the 135 rung is zero too — the decoupling is a two-rung fact

- t(54/126, 2/10)@135 = 0 at 3/3 primes. The seam ↔ value-sector coincidence is exclusive to
  the base level 15 (dark at 45 exact-banked, dark at 135 CRT). The graded-pair ratio ladder
  is dead as registered; the structural fact is the deliverable. W2 exits at session 2 of 3.

## 2026-07-04 — W3.i (B388): the m=2 transport KILL + coarsening structure

- C0-C3 all fail (exhaustive); reason: level-45 m=2 singles are strictly coarser (two bare
  values by a mod 3; c₁ ≡ 0; c₂ even-supported, odd under a→a+6, pattern (1,2,1)/48). The
  seeds have OPPOSITE level behavior: m=1 identical transport, m=2 coarsening. 4 locks.

## 2026-07-04 — W3.ii (B389): the mirror is NOT inversion — the dihedral route is twist-blocked

- M3 ✓ ([Ŝ,Par]=0); M1/M2 killed; ŜW₁Ŝ⁻¹ matches W₁⁻¹ in support (0/225) but not phases —
  inversion is twist-broken (P62 pattern), so the mirror is twist-compatible, not a group
  shadow. W3.i+ii both done in session 1; W3.iii (criterion) has 2 sessions.

## 2026-07-04 — W3.iii (B390, P67): BRIGHTNESS IS LOCAL — predictive out-of-sample

- Tensor identity 12/12 pairs; s-classification from local q=3,5 data alone 12/12; the
  registered out-of-sample PASSED ((2,5): predicted dark locally, verified dark globally).
  D3(a)'s riddle localized to the local-spectra pairing. Attribution = session 3 (the
  per-side Π_H columns are flagged unreliable — the standing hazard, subtler form).

## 2026-07-04 — W3 COMPLETE: the attribution via the exact rank-2 pairing

- B(ζ₁₂^r, ζ₂₀^s) computed exactly (4×8, rank 2). Dark pairs split: KERNEL-KILLED
  {(1,5),(4,5)} (5-side in the right-kernel; partners are the 5-parabolic twins) vs
  CONVOLUTION-CANCELLED {(1,3),(1,4),(3,5)} (the subtle class, riddle included). W3 closes
  at session 3/3; residue named (the cancellation mechanism).

## 2026-07-04 — W4 COMPLETE: both census predictions HIT — the general-N statement banked

- 243: doublet ±81/ord 324/90°; 625: no doublet/line@0/ord 1250 (2 primes each, registered
  first). General law: sector exists at 3^a·5^b iff NOT(a even AND b even) — every banked
  rung + the duel reproduced. All-k proof named to the specialist register (local theta
  correspondence). W4 done in one session.

## 2026-07-04 — W5 COMPLETE: all three walls priced

- SCALE: seed constant FROZEN (1/4 at three levels — no running); support walks twisted
  (29 mod 45 at 135 — registered support guess killed, new data banked). CHIRALITY: E₆
  θ-grading ⊥ seam at exponent level (bridge = the known CRUX). DYNAMICS: TIM dead at S
  and T. Probes done in one session; W6 (dossiers + wrap) remains.

## 2026-07-04 — W6: dossiers written; Review 4; THE CLOSURE CAMPAIGN COMPLETE

- Both specialist dossiers ready (not sent; outreach dormant); Review 4 anchored; synthesis
  in RECOGNITION.md. Campaign totals: PRs #490–#501, P66+P67 promoted, five structural
  kills, general-N law, three walls priced, every wave at or under time-box.

## 2026-07-04 — Closure II / M1 session 1: K1-STRONG — termwise s-orthogonality

- No cancellation exists: dark non-kernel pairs have EVERY convolution term zero (bright
  controls have teeth). Dark classes = KERNEL vs MUTUAL-ANNIHILATION. Instrument correction
  banked (full-field spectra required; bright-controls-read-zero caught the broken form).

- M1 addendum: (1,4) termwise-zero confirmed (0/39) — the mutual-annihilation class is fully covered.

## 2026-07-04 — Closure II M1 COMPLETE: the product-field stratification law

- K2 killed (identical Galois patterns); the law: the annihilation class's 5-side never
  donates √5 to an imaginary product ((1,4)/(3,5) products fully real; (1,3) z-only;
  bright complements s-carrying). M2's 405 prediction registered (59 mod 135) and running.

## 2026-07-05 — M2 COMPLETE: the unified singles law — (1+c)/12 and the sum rule

- Both registered 405 candidates killed (support ≡ 31 mod 45, twelve cells). The reward:
  values = (1+c)/12 over ζ₉⁺ orbits; 1/4 = (1+2)/12 degenerate; Σ_support = 1 frozen at all
  levels. W5 P-SCALE verdict amended (sum frozen, not the cell value). Import-trap guards
  banked (census_big, k1_fullfield).

## 2026-07-05 — M3 COMPLETE (kill): the mirror is emergent — no cell-local origin

- Cell-wise σ-law fails 140/240 (both lifts); passing set ≠ ±I mod 3 (staged). The mirror
  is a summation-level symmetry — the twist admits it only in aggregate (cf. B389).

## 2026-07-05 — M4 COMPLETE: the formula is universal (661/661, all six pairs)

- Zero mismatches on every banked pair's domain; the complete banked dataset is now
  formula-derived; D3(c) closed; P64 strengthened in place.

## 2026-07-05 — M5 + CLOSURE II COMPLETE: the object is computation-complete

- (a) the (2,3) stabilizer is aggregate (third emergent symmetry; no local relabel exists);
  (b) the σ√5 trace-conjugacy is intra-model (corrected; new face value ±1/24). Synthesis
  in RECOGNITION.md: everything derived or precisely named; no computable questions remain
  at level 15.

## 2026-07-05 — B398 S1–S4: the handoff's math scrutinized

- VERIFIED: the 1/24 doublet; the F₄ Gram and 23/75 (fork pinned vs 23/25); 98/−52; (3,4)
  7/5; the ℤ/3 point's exactness; all ranks; the fiber pattern. CORRECTED/UNSUPPORTED:
  (2,3) "1/3" mislabel; "tensor rank 4"; 296/464; the σ⊗Weil(5) adjoint bridge. The 7 has
  banked provenance (φ⁴+φ⁻⁴, B109). S5 gate next.

## 2026-07-05 — B398 COMPLETE: S5 gate kills the PMNS ensemble; math banked as math

- Binding verdict: p ≈ 0.087 raw / 0.44 corrected vs the registered 0.01 — numerology-class
  (S042, firewalled; revival bar = a derivation, not a match). The exact seam-form
  mathematics (23/75, doublet, 98/−52, 7/5, the ℤ/3 point) stands as banked structure.

## 2026-07-05 — Wall campaign W-A3: the two 1/12s are different objects

- Singles' 1/4: class-1 only (boundaries cancel exactly; counts {1:5, 3:5, 5:10} on l=0).
  Seam's 1/12: generic + golden boundary. The twist's value content = boundary
  recruitment. 1215 rung computing (walk-law duel registered).

## 2026-07-05 — Wall W-B1 COMPLETE: no canonical frame (the kill, maximally sharp)

- The golden slot rows are antipodal (one line, labels ±2); the Mercedes plane's support
  omits exactly {±2, 6}; exact orthogonality by spectral support disjointness. No
  canonical 3×3 exists — the content wall priced; S5 grounded geometrically.

## 2026-07-04 — W-C session 1 (the owner's sixth angle): the class group is load-bearing

- H = Hilbert class field of ℚ(√−15); σ_cl pairs slot↔−3block AND B382-face↔B397-face;
  the split-covariance prediction CONFIRMED exactly (3-block: −1/16,+1/16 ⊕ −1/48,+1/48).
  Prime spectroscopy banked (23, 2 non-principal; 7, 11, 13 inert; naive channel-sorting
  bet killed by 7-in-spectrum). P3/P4 next.

## 2026-07-04 — B402 Q1: the pair-requirement wall splits by seed (local vs emergent)

- m=1: cell-wise real (locally forbidden). m=2: aggregate-only (units j ∈ {1,5,7,11}
  carry ±1/8, window-cancelled). The narrative's best line refined into two mechanisms.
  Q2 (the twist-address 3-orbit) registered with the address-measurement pipeline.

## 2026-07-04 — W-C session 2: two genus selection rules + the identity dossier

- The Eisenstein gate (z ≡ 0 on χ₋₃ = +1 generic sectors); boundary equipartition (4 cells
  = 64 cells = −1/96 each). Dossier: H-basis = Gauss-sum basis of the genus characters;
  entropy = 4Reg = 2√5·L(1,χ₅); the seam character carries h = 2.

## 2026-07-04 — B403: the six-leads package scrutinized

- The prime-filter theorem: VACUOUS on denominators (group-order smoothness; the 17/19
  prediction can never fire) and REFUTED on numerators (inert 7, 13, 49 banked in seam
  quantities). Sentinels 17/19 recorded for future numerator tests. The six leads map to
  banked/running work (L3's bridge already dead; L4 = W-A in flight).

## 2026-07-04 — B401 addendum: the Eisenstein gate is CELL-WISE (26/26 fully real)

- Chat-1's orthogonality reading tested: stronger than proposed — χ₋₃(det)=+1 class-1
  cells are individually ℚ(√5)-real (z = s = 0). Local law; mechanism = Gauss-sum field
  content. Chat-2 retirement noted (cross-check discipline now CC + Chat-1).

## 2026-07-04 — Q2′: the seam landscape — the canonical point is the unique null

- All 15 addresses: r=0 null (P62 anchor ✓); 14 bright with intensity f(gcd(r,15)) =
  {1:44, 3:32, 5:36}. Every twist opens the channel; classicality is measure-zero in the
  address space. The corrected prereg's candidate (i) + a finer stratification law.

## 2026-07-04 — B404 → P68: the root-of-unity law; the Eisenstein gate derived

- 142/142 generic cells are roots of unity; 3|ord ⟺ χ₋₃(det)=−1 (0 violations); χ₅=−1
  forces the 5-part one-directionally. The gate is now an order theorem.

## 2026-07-04 — the 1215 rung: both walk candidates KILLED; v0 = 1/12 (third appearance);
B405: supersingular pair verified {7,23} (only ones < 30), dictionary deflated by controls
(11/13/17/19 all give 16), sentinels {31, 79, 167} banked; retcon flagged third time.

## 2026-07-04 — A2 + THE WALL CAMPAIGN WRAP

- A2: monotone contraction — the tower refines, never runs; Wall 1 priced exactly.
  Synthesis in RECOGNITION.md; both walls priced with mechanisms; the sixth angle is the
  campaign's discovery (class group, genus gates, P68). Decision gate to the owner.

## 2026-07-04 — B406: the two-conductor bridge verified, then deflated by torsion

- Hecke pattern exact as claimed; mod-4 congruence holds to p<200 but is FORCED by
  rational torsion (Z/8 on 15a1; full 2-torsion on 40a1) — the quantization-map lead dies
  at the congruence level. The 31-collision tension filed (principal-absent vs sentinel).
  Hooks ledgered.

## 2026-07-04 — B407: support nesting — (1,2) verified, law killed at (2,4), reversed at (1,3)

- Their 16 s-only cells check exactly; universality dies ((2,4) both-exclusives; (1,3)
  reversed). The find: per-pair nesting mirrors the M1 product strata exactly. Fact-1
  record corrected (φ⁴+φ⁻⁴=7 already banked; 23-extension overclaim flagged).

## 2026-07-04 — THE MASTERPLAN banked (docs/MASTERPLAN.md)

- Five phases: loaded questions → coupling-channel theory → named gates → the paper →
  the gated physics frontier. Sentinels armed; multi-seat protocol formalized; intake
  note filed on the synthesis handoff (two §1 corrections, A2 lag).

## 2026-07-04 — PHASE 1b: THE SEAM DOES NOT CONTRACT (ratio ≈ 1.217, 15→45)

- The singles contract; the seam grows. The boundary channel is the one scale-lever
  candidate; Wall 1 open through exactly this door. Next rung named (the 135 pair sweep).
  Third prime for the triple ID still grinding (watcher armed).

## 2026-07-04 — THE NOVELTY MAP banked (docs/dossiers/NOVELTY_MAP.md)

- The informed triage before any agent sweep: 5 K-items (cite), 4 L-items (find the
  dictionary), 5 N-items (adversarial hunt). Each with its agent brief. Sweep launches
  on the owner's go, after Phase 1a per the verdicts-first ordering.

## 2026-07-04 — Sweep round 1 intake: 4 APPEARS-NOVEL confirmations, 3 tool-citations

- The sweep maps onto the novelty map's N-items 1:1; Gelca–Uribe cited as the closest
  prior (our pair+parity extends their single-seed frame); Kirillov–Ostrik filed as the
  CRT-phase tool; Niibo–Ueki reciprocity registered as the genus-gating reading; the E₆
  character variety registered APPEARS-NOVEL in the specialist register.

## 2026-07-04 — the 135 scout: gate FAILED, scout VOID (the binding gate working as built)

- Pipeline omitted the inner Π_H average; fix specified; the exact Phase-2 sweep
  supersedes. No void numbers anywhere. Third prime ~30 min out.

## 2026-07-04 — Sweep round 2 (Chat-2): downgrades accepted; Paper-1 phrasing governor set

- B204=Jeffrey'92, B205=skein-standard (both cite-only); B264 reconciled: known framework,
  apparently-first worked instance. Paper 1 claims novelty only in the overlays (the
  APPEARS-NOVEL core) + instance-firstness. Chat-2 active again.

## 2026-07-04 — the revival hunt: B334 vindicated (dead → B401/P68); oracle patterns banked

- The first complete atlas revival cycle. Cancellation-oracle pattern (termwise-first)
  and the units_scale bulk annotation recorded; S032-A and H4 gain class-field language.

## 2026-07-04 — PHASE 1a BANKED: sum rule confirmed at depth 5; the value field deepens

- Gate 0: triple sums to zero (3/3 primes) — Σ = 1 through the whole tested tower. The
  triple resists ζ₉⁺ and ℚ(√5): degree-6 reconstruction launched (primes 4–6, watcher).
  Revival hunt banked earlier (B334 vindicated). Next: THE FINAL MASTERPLAN.

## 2026-07-04 — S043: the energy package's verdicts banked

- Exact: the 3+3 exponent split; the ∏=6 cyclotomy. Deflated: the Φ₆ mislabel, the
  rank-E₆ dressing, the unreproducible mass values, the self-flagged exp(−48). Extracted:
  the spectral-triple construction + E₆ recursion as Phase-3 candidates.

## 2026-07-04 — PANEL CORRECTION: the seam contracts too — Wall 1 fully priced

- The adversarial masterplan panel caught the Phase-1b persistence as an embedding-max
  artifact. Embedding-invariant RMS: env45/env15 = 0.76 < 1 — the seam CONTRACTS. Every
  internal channel contracts; the object has NO scale lever. The one open door closes;
  any physical scale must be external. B408 corrected in place with a lock.

## 2026-07-04 — THE MASTERPLAN FINAL: panel-hardened, corrected foundation

- 3-member adversarial panel run; the pivot (seam persistence) caught as an artifact and
  corrected (PR #528). Final plan: scale wall fully priced (all channels contract, scale
  external); Phase 2 = the coupling-channel DERIVATION theory (2c→2b, 2b's binding
  acceptance test = the convolution-cancellation residue); Phase 3 definitional-first
  (spectral triple, Gate B=L50 with B299 banked); Paper 1 ∥ Phase 2 (governed scope,
  W-A/W-B relocated); Phase 5 entry gate DEFINED; sentinels given an explicit trigger;
  SL(n) register declined. Awaiting owner sign-off.

## 2026-07-04 — Phase 2c (B409): the transport theorem KILLED — B407 folds into P67/M1

- Count conservation holds 4/6 (fails at high-multiplicity bright pairs, DFT non-injective
  on strata). B407 is P67/M1 restated (multiplicity ≤ 1 only), not a separate theorem;
  Paper-1 overclaim prevented. Phase 2c done; 2b (the long pole) next.

## 2026-07-04 — the 1215 triple (partial): sum rule EXACT over Q; e₂ = −1/48

- Cubic t³ − (1/48)t − e₃; e₁ = 0 exact (sum rule proven at depth 5 over Q), e₂ = −1/48
  (the seam coefficient recurs — 4th appearance). e₃ pending primes 7–10; the sentinel
  test is on e₃. Triple = ζ₂₇-level Z/3 orbit; the line = 1/12 × 12.

## 2026-07-04 — Phase 2b (B410): the crown advanced to its exact boundary

- 2b-i: no window involution realizes σ_cl — the class action is EMERGENT (M3 pattern for
  σ_cl). 2b-ii: the cancellation criterion separates 4/4 on the FULL-FIELD product object
  (= P67 at product resolution + M1 stratification, banked); the deep √5-withholding
  residual STAGES (the Π_H-per-side hazard, 4th appearance, forbids a per-side statement).
  Two-outcome success: derivation-to-M1 + a named wall.

## 2026-07-04 — hint sweep (B411): the local/emergent dichotomy; work upstairs in Q(zeta60)

- Naive field-dictionary killed (generic multi-valued) but localizes the direction: the
  negatives are one structure — Pi_H is the boundary between a local/derivable layer and an
  emergent/aggregate layer. New angle: study the raw table UPSTAIRS in Q(zeta60) before
  Pi_H; the emergent symmetries become projection corollaries. Ledgered.

## 2026-07-04 — "what else" (B412): the tower is a refining MEASURE (Iwasawa-type)

- Exact: mass=1 frozen, parents split into cyclotomic orbits summing to them, innovations
  trace-zero. The scale wall killed hierarchy but the tower carries a p-adic measure. New
  lever: its p-adic L-function / Mellin transform (plugs into entropy=4Reg=2sqrt5 L(1,chi5)).

## 2026-07-04 — SCALE-GENESIS VERDICT (B413): the measure is FLAT — no scale genesis

- |L(chi,mu)| = mass for all characters (12 L(chi_1) = an exact Z[zeta9] Gauss sum, norm 9)
  -> outcome (b) reducible. The object generates NO scale through any channel (hierarchy
  B408 + measure B413). The scale wall is closed at the mechanism level; any scale is
  external. Terminal statement stands; Paper 1 is the deliverable. A full SM-derivation
  campaign is NOT licensed (the precondition failed at the last candidate mechanism).

## 2026-07-04 — the structure reframe (S044/B414): honest engagement with 'we have to see it'

- Took the reframe seriously (object as SM STRUCTURE not numbers; scale-external as correct
  factorization; emergent-symmetries as flavor-structure-shaped). Pre-registered structural
  test 1 (forced-Z/3 = generations): FAILS privilege (core multiplicity is Z/2, the class
  group). But it LOCATES the obstruction precisely: seeing SM content reduces to the
  content-wall frame (W-B1, no canonical frame), which the object doesn't self-provide.
  Honest fork: external structural frame, or not there. One untried probe: the class-group
  Z/2 as frame-provider. Firewalled (S044); no promotion.

## 2026-07-04 — BEHAVIOR-TRACKING (B415 T1): the tower's destination is named math, no SM

- Method adopted (track blind, name as math, registered emergence bar). T1: the tower-
  measure's continuum limit = Gauss-sum-modulated Haar on Z_3 x Z/5 (anchored by B413's
  exact level-9 flat result). Emergence bar NOT cleared (forced invariants are Q_3/Q_5
  arithmetic, no SM structure, none sought). The disciplined negative. Other behaviors
  (trace-map dynamics, upstairs Q(zeta60), coupling channel) still to track.

## 2026-07-04 — Destination Atlas TW2 (B416): the dynamics leads to golden-Anosov, no SM

- Void Jacobian {φ⁻⁴,1,φ⁴} confirmed; coordinate symmetry trivial (order 1); real symmetry
  = modular/mapping-class. Forced invariants (4logφ, κ, modular group) — none an SM
  structure; generic to the metallic family (fails the control too). Atlas #2, named math.

## 2026-07-04 — Destination Atlas TW3 (B417): symbolic dynamics = Sturmian quasicrystal, no SM

- p(n)=n+1, entropy 0, gap group Z+Z phi. Contrast: subshift zero-entropy vs flow 4logphi.
  Named math, bar not cleared. Atlas #3.

## 2026-07-04 — Destination Atlas TW4 (B418): emergence is INTRINSIC; B411 upstairs-hope refuted

- The mirror is not cell-local even upstairs in Q(zeta60) (all 16 Galois elements fail on the
  raw table). Emergence is a genuine feature, not a projection artifact. Raw cells rich
  (4-13/16) but unsymmetric. Bar not cleared. Atlas #4. B411 annotated (hope closed for mirror).

## 2026-07-04 — Destination Atlas TW6 + TW7: campaign COMPLETE — SM does not emerge unbidden

- TW6: entropy=4Reg=2sqrt5 L(1,chi5) verified; genus-character L-landscape of Q(sqrt-15).
  TW7 synthesis: all six destinations named math, NO bar cleared. Terminal statement: the
  object self-generates no SM structure (no scale, no frame); coherent golden/Q(sqrt-15)
  mathematics. Paper 2 = the atlas. The behavior-tracking method delivered a decisive,
  non-self-deceiving negative.

## 2026-07-04 — B422: the Z/2 (mirror/class-group) frame test -- NO FRAME, wall holds both sides

- The owner's 'interacting mirror' intuition, disciplined (Z/2 as content-frame): the golden
  line and its mirror are BOTH orthogonal to the Mercedes plane (cos^2=0). The content wall
  holds under Z/2 as under Z/3 (W-B1). B414's last in-object frame door closes; the frame is
  external. One untested variant (tensor double) with a strong prior against (flatness +
  orthogonality are product-stable). Markov-blanket framing refused; testable core tested.

## 2026-07-04 — GATE B COMPUTED (B423): the E6 torsion = Fibonacci-square product

- The owner's compute-don't-argue point vindicated: tau(E6) = prod(-5)^m (prod F_2j)^2,
  prime content = Fibonacci apparition primes {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,29,41,47,89,199} -- rich
  forced structure the symmetry tests missed, figure-eight-specific (control = Pell primes).
  Bar (iii) fails: Fibonacci arithmetic, not SM. The wall holds from the computation side
  too. A new theorem (closed-form E6 torsion) for the papers.

## 2026-07-04 — THE UNIFYING PRINCIPLE (knowledge/THE_GOLDEN_CAT_MAP_PRINCIPLE.md)

- The object IS the golden cat map, written in seven languages: every face (symbolic,
  dynamics, torsion, quantum, measure, L-function, value theory) is a spectral/dynamical
  invariant of A=[[2,1],[1,1]], all golden-field-valued. Hinge (verified): the E6 torsion
  = the cat map's periodic-orbit product (5F_2j^2 = #Fix(A^2j)) -- quantum topology = dynamics.
  The walls are the CORRECT properties of golden-field arithmetic. Broad story: a complete,
  novel instance of the quantum-topology / arithmetic / dynamics trinity on the figure-eight,
  unified by phi and Q(sqrt-15).

## 2026-07-04 — GATE B COMPLETE (B424 Hessian golden) + THE CORNERSTONE found

- B424: the Hessian frequency spectrum is Fibonacci-golden (same apparition primes, no SM
  mass ratio within 2%). Gate B golden to the last term. THE CORNERSTONE: 4_1 is the unique
  object that is BOTH the simplest golden cat map's mapping torus (=>Q(sqrt5)) AND the unique
  arithmetic knot (Reid 1991 => Q(sqrt-3)); the double uniqueness forces the seam field
  Q(sqrt-15) and everything downstream. Why THIS object: the unique meeting of golden dynamics
  and Eisenstein arithmetic. Special for mathematics, not physics. The founding intuition
  honored (uniquely distinguished) and corrected (for the trinity, not the SM).

## 2026-07-04 — THE FLAGSHIP CAMPAIGN launched: the two papers (F1 outlines)

- Paper 1 (value theory, 10 locked theorems) + Paper 2 (the trinity: cornerstone + seven-face
  dictionary + Gate B + walls). Both entirely banked+lock-backed. The warranted master
  campaign (not a TOE hunt). Outlines banked; F2 = the theorem-statement pass next.

## 2026-07-04 — Flagship F2: Paper 2 theorem spine (cornerstone + 10 theorems, lock-backed)

- The cornerstone as Theorem 1 (double uniqueness -> seam field); the seven-face dictionary
  as Theorems 2-8 (each with proof sketch + lock); the walls as Theorems 9-10. The
  torsion=periodic-orbits hinge (Thm 4) with the full derivation. Paper 2's mathematical
  spine complete.

## 2026-07-04 — THE UNIQUENESS ATLAS (first assembly + deep-investigation campaign plan)

- The figure-eight is extremal in ~12 independent ways, splitting golden (G1-G5: cat map,
  min-dilatation pA, Alexander=char poly, 2-bridge 5/2, entropy) / Eisenstein (E1-E5: unique
  arithmetic, 2 regular ideal tetrahedra, min-volume cusped, Bianchi PSL(2,O-3), Bloch group)
  / amphichiral (X1-X2 = the class-group Z/2) / meeting (M1 simplest hyperbolic knot). The
  deep campaign (U1-U5, after the papers): complete the atlas, map connections to the
  cornerstone, test whether the uniqueness list is ONE fact, push each angle, synthesize
  (Paper 3). Enriches Paper 2's cornerstone section.

## 2026-07-04 — Flagship F2 complete: Paper 1 theorem spine (11 lock-backed theorems)

- The value-theory theorems (order law, twist invariant, trace formula + 1/12, closed form,
  locality, existence law, root-of-unity gate, row-16, Galois covariance, class-field
  organization, the walls) with precise statements + locks. Both papers now have complete
  theorem spines. F3 (dictionary/figures) + F4 (prose) next.

## 2026-07-04 — Flagship: reproducibility ledger (74/74 locks green) + cornerstone upgraded

- Every paper theorem mapped to its lock + reproducer; the whole backbone verified green.
  Paper 2's cornerstone upgraded to the strong two-FAMILIES form (golden family / Eisenstein
  family meeting minimally). The papers' foundation (outlines + theorem spines + verification
  backbone + strong cornerstone) is complete; F4 prose is the remaining fill.

## 2026-07-04 — Flagship: polished abstracts for both papers; the foundation is complete

- Paper 1 (value theory) + Paper 2 (the trinity) abstracts written. The papers' submission-
  track FOUNDATION is complete: outlines + theorem spines (11 + cornerstone/10) + verification
  backbone (74/74 green) + strong two-families cornerstone + abstracts. Remaining: F3 figures
  + F4 full prose (the multi-session fill). The deep-investigation campaign (U1-U5) is queued
  after.

## 2026-07-04 — B425: the object has TWO E₆ torsions (a cross-chat catch, verified and banked)

- **A cross-chat catch was correct, and it TIGHTENS the papers.** B423 had computed
  τ_m = det(I − Sym^{2m}(A)) with A = [[2,1],[1,1]] — the figure-eight's *homological
  monodromy* (the golden cat map) — and its prereg mislabelled this "the torsion at the
  holonomy / at the parabolic geometric point." It is not: A is the monodromy, not ρ_geo.
  B423 correctly computed the **dynamical zeta** (golden by construction, adjoint −5); it did
  not compute the geometric torsion.
- **B425 computes the geometric torsion at the true holonomy ρ_geo** (a↦[[1,1],[0,1]],
  b↦[[1,0],[−u,1]], with ρ(relator)=I FORCING u²+u+1=0 ⇒ u=ω, trace field ℚ(√−3)). Exact via
  Fox/Wada + CRT over primes p≡1 mod 3, validated by the trivial rep reproducing the ordinary
  Alexander polynomial t²−3t+1. Result: the twisted Alexander coefficients are **rational
  integers at every E₆ exponent** (√−3 cancels — the determinant is Galois-invariant), and the
  **canonical adjoint value is −3 = disc ℚ(√−3)** (numerator t²−5t+1). This **reproduces the
  banked V30** (normal Reidemeister torsion at the κ=−2 root) **and V31** (Porti adjoint-torsion
  form) — three independent methods agree on −3.
- **Where √−3 lives vs cancels:** the Fox MATRIX carries √−3 (trace = 2+3√3·i at m=1; Im(trace)
  ≠0 at all six exponents, mpmath 120-digit) but it CANCELS in every determinant/torsion. The
  cross-chat's precision blow-up (relerr 10²⁹ at m=11) is a pure double-precision artifact —
  ~10⁻¹¹⁵ at 120 digits.
- **The two torsions = the two cornerstone sides:** dynamical zeta (golden, ℚ(√5), −5) and
  geometric torsion (Eisenstein, ℚ(√−3), −3); √5·√−3 = √−15 = the seam. The double uniqueness
  is now two *computed* discriminants, not just two theorems.
- **Emergence bar: still NOT cleared.** Eisenstein/rational arithmetic is the object's second
  cornerstone field (Reid's arithmetic-knot field), named mathematics — not a gauge group,
  generation count, or anomaly lattice. The "√−3 door" opens onto ℚ(√−3), not physics. Wall holds.
- **Guard banked:** a follow-up "the Fox torsion is −25−13ω, norm 469=7·67, new prime 67" claim
  is a **presentation artifact** — that quantity is the product of the two nonzero eigenvalues of
  the un-normalized Fox matrix, which is RATIONAL for ∂r/∂a, t-dependent, and not an invariant;
  the invariant (normalized determinant) is −3. No new prime.
- **Corrections applied:** B423 (CORRECTION.md + banner), knowledge/THE_GOLDEN_CAT_MAP_PRINCIPLE.md
  (dictionary row + hinge), Paper 2 ABSTRACT/OUTLINE/THEOREMS (Thm 4 → 4a dynamical zeta / 4b
  geometric torsion + two-torsion corollary), REPRODUCIBILITY_LEDGER (T4a/T4b). Locks:
  tests/test_b425_geometric_torsion.py (10/10); affected suite 15/15 green.

## 2026-07-05 — the handoff adjudication (B426/B427/B428) + the Origin-Postulate campaign running

Context: the Origin Postulate locked (PR #548) — D: object → physics lives at the INTERFACE; the
owner's mandate: compute the unfolding continuously, update the repo as we go. Two cross-chat
handoffs received (Chat-1 session summary; Chat-2 four-file zip). All adjudicated verify-don't-trust:

- **B426 — the scale-lever closed form (Chat-2 G1 VERIFIED) + the Galois-orbit contraction
  theorem (new).** env₄₅/env₁₅ = (3α²+4α−1)/10, α=2cos(2π/9), minpoly 1000x³−1500x²+360x−19,
  cyclic cubic in ℚ(ζ₉)⁺, √5-free — verified from the banked B372 sweep45.json exact coefficients
  (cell (4,8) √−15 sector (1/96,−1/160,1/480); exhaustive 144×3 scan confirms the max at
  (4,8)/emb2; symbolic identity exact). NEW: the three "embeddings" are the three GALOIS
  CONJUGATES; mean = 1/2, RMS = √51/10 ≈ 0.714, geometric mean = (19/1000)^{1/3} ≈ 0.267 —
  EVERY Galois-invariant functional < 1; growth exists only under non-invariant max. The B408
  correction is now a THEOREM (the object supplies no invariant functional under which the seam
  grows). G2 structural half credited (√5-freeness forced by CRT locality; P63/P66/P67 verified
  present); the quantitative C₉/C₃ level-9 build logged open.
- **B427 — the twisted exchange trace: Chat-1's base identity TRUE, corollary CORRECTED, and the
  correction is a discovery.** tr(W₁·Par·W₂) = tr_{V⊗V}(Q(W₁⊗W₂)) with Q=(Par⊗I)P verified;
  Q-multiplicities {57,56,56,56} verified combinatorially. But Chat-1's tr(Q³·)=tr(Q·) step is
  FALSE on the actual Weil matrices: C = tr(Par·W₂W₁) = ζ₁₅ ≠ C′ = tr(Par·W₁W₂) = ζ₁₅².
  Corrected projector traces: ±1 sectors see the SYMMETRIZED seam (C+C′)/2, ±i the
  ANTISYMMETRIZED (C−C′)/2. STRUCTURAL PAYOFF: C′ = σ₁₇(C) — exchange acts by a GALOIS element
  that flips √5 and √−3 but FIXES √−15: the seam's physical channel is exchange-symmetric.
  Extends the "symmetries ARE Galois" law (P61/B380; B369 rotation = √5-Galois; now exchange = σ₁₇).
- **B428 — the two upstairs spin walls, three-seat cross-validated.** (1) E₆ level 1 = the ℤ/3
  Eisenstein anyon theory: primaries h = {0, 2/3, 2/3}, twist ω — NO θ=−1, zero fermions
  (Chat-2 prereg confirmed; standard prior art flagged). (2) The principal sl2 (the only forced
  embedding) makes 27 = [17,9,1] and 78 all integer-spin — the canonical E₆↔Lorentz bridge is
  bosonic-only (two independent routes agree with S049). Spacetime chain disposition aligned
  across seats: holonomy=Spin(3,1)/mass-shell real but fails the CONTROL bar-leg (generic to
  hyperbolic geometry); O1 stays OPEN. REGISTERED NEXT INTERFACE TARGET (Phase I.2): the actual
  relationship between the E₆ rep and ρ_geo on the one π₁ — is the bosonic verdict rigid along
  B347's 6-dim unobstructed moduli? Read off, not assumed.
- Chat-1's §2/§7 self-kills accepted (E₇/E₈ dimension coincidences, "96=3 generations", the 67,
  Par=P=θ conflation, F₄→G₂-as-involution). Chat-2's meta: context drift caught by the multi-seat
  protocol (retracted stale campaign) — the B398 pattern is load-bearing.
- Locks: test_b426 (5), test_b427 (3), test_b428 (2) — 10/10 green; atlas 408; gates green.

## 2026-07-05 — the interface arc → THE CHILD PROGRAM (B429–B438)

- **B429–B434 — the interface arc: from the handoff adjudication to the forced child.** B429
  Bosonic Rigidity (the bosonic verdict along B347's E₆ moduli); B430 the sl2 landscape; B431
  the seam spatial split; B432 filling chirality (ALL fillings of the parent are chiral — the
  interface is chiral-sourced — yet the forced ±5 output exits ℚ(√−15)); B433 the 3d-3d DGG
  calibration (eliminant = −A_CL(M,L)·A_CL(M,−L), pinned at SL(2)); **B434 slope selection**:
  ±5 = the boundary of the maximal exceptional set {0,±1,…,±4}; the forced child = the
  **Meyerhoff manifold 4₁(5,1)**, H₁ = ℤ/5, trace field x⁴−x−1, disc −283, CS unit ±0.0770381802.
- **B435 (C0) — the Child Program founding.** H₁ = ℤ/5; the abelian E₆ vacuum count derived:
  Hom(ℤ/5,E₆)/conj = 25 nontrivial (= 5²) + 1 trivial = **26** (Kac Σaᵢmᵢ=5 mod the ℤ/3
  center-rotation, all orbits free since 3∤5). CORRECTED (#562): the ℤ/5 "birthmark" is
  numerator-forced (every knot at slope 5), not inheritance.
- **B436 (C1) — the child's identity card.** The Borel identity EXACT: vol = 12·|d|^{3/2}·ζ_K(2)/(4π²)³
  to |ratio−12| = 4.5×10⁻⁶⁴; CS not identified (honest open residue). CORRECTED (B438): the
  bud shipped with only the slope control; the −283 field is class-shared with 5₂, not fig-8-unique.
- **B437 (C2) — the abelian torsion book + the Inversion Law.** The "golden return"
  (Tr τ = 3+√5/5 ∈ ℚ(√5)) RETRACTED as inheritance: numerator-forced (trefoil(5,1) gives the
  same field). The Lucas-square law (total torsion = |Res(Φ₅,Δ_K)| = L₅² = 121). **THE INVERSION
  LAW banked**: every inherited-looking child feature is forced-for-all-knots; every
  fig-8-specific feature is parent-disjoint.
- **B438 — the missing FOREIGN control: nothing about the child is figure-eight-UNIQUE (the
  July-5 audit's decisive finding).** 5₂(5,1) also gives x⁴−x−1 (disc −283) AND the same 121
  torsion value; 6₁/m003/m007 differ. {4₁,5₂} = a commensurability class. The Inversion Law
  becomes THREE TIERS — (1) numerator-forced (all knots at slope 5); (2) commensurability-shared
  (4₁≈5₂: −283, 121); (3) figure-eight-UNIQUE = none. Break criterion RAISED: a genuine break
  must distinguish 4₁ from 5₂ → C3's control set now includes 5₂. Corrects B436/B437 wording.
  Lock test_b438 (3/3).
- **The 2026-07-05 repo audit (docs/AUDIT_2026-07-05.md).** Three parallel auditors + Chat-1's
  own audit reconciled: hygiene fixes (B435/B436/B437 wording, founding.py labels), the B438
  correctness catch (the skipped foreign control), the leads re-score (Cluster A metallic
  A-poly / L54 gate-A torsion / e₃ now-unblockable), and the e₃ guard (triple_cubic.json
  unconverged, stamped). Board + LEAD_REGISTER refreshed.

## 2026-07-05 (cont.) — C3 opens: the child's SL(2) vacuum book (B439)

- **B439 (C3) — the child's SL(2,C) vacuum book (figure-eight core + slope control).** The
  child 4₁(5,1)'s irreducible SL(2,C) vacua = the banked B67 Cooper–Long A-polynomial on the
  (5,1)-line L=M⁻⁵; in the meridian trace t=M+1/M: Q₅(t) = (t+2)·(t⁴−3t³+t²+3t−1) = 1 reducible
  + 4 irreducible vacua. The vacuum quartic has disc −283 and IS the child's own invariant trace
  field x⁴−x−1 (explicit root α³−α², verified by remainder; both S₄, disc −283) — the −283
  reproduce-gate passes rigorously. Slope-7 control: (t+2)·(sextic), 6 vacua, disc 50173=131·383
  — different count AND field (slope control passes). Verdict HELD pending the 5₂ foreign control
  (B438's tier-3 bar). A-poly gluing-elimination reproduced 4₁ (Cooper–Long) and 6₁ but
  degenerated on snappy's default 5₂/3₁ triangulations → foreign control will use the
  closed-manifold character variety directly. Lock test_b439 (4/4).

- **B440 (C3 foreign control COMPLETE) — no figure-eight-unique feature at the SL(2) floor.**
  The SL(2,C) vacuum spectra of the closed manifolds K(5,1), computed convention-free from π₁
  (2-generator groups, both relators = I, eliminated to the meridian trace): 4₁ [child] = 4
  vacua all in the −283 field (character-variety quartic x⁴−3x³+x²+3x−1 = B439's Cooper–Long
  A-poly quartic EXACTLY — two independent methods agree); 5₂ [neighbour] = 6 vacua = 2 in
  ℚ(√5) + 4 in the SAME −283 field (mutual-containment field iso); 3₁ = 5 (disc 11⁴); 6₁ = 11.
  Tier-3 verdict: the −283 field is commensurability-shared (as B438 predicted); the count is
  A-poly-degree genericity; the GOLDEN INVERSION — the ℚ(√5) vacua the golden parent (Δ₄₁
  golden) might transmit are ABSENT in the child, PRESENT in the non-golden 5₂'s child. Surgery
  launders identity; the Inversion Law's 4th instance, at the SL(2) floor, tested against the
  commensurability neighbour — the sharpest. C3 complete; C5 (WRT) is the next knot-dependent
  channel. Lock test_b440 (4/4).

- **B440 CORRECTION (2026-07-05, adversarial decadal review).** The independent reviewer (fresh
  recomputation, reducibility saturation) refuted two sub-claims of the just-banked B440, both
  verified here: (1) 5₂'s golden factor x²+x−1 is the **REDUCIBLE abelian ℤ/5 characters**
  (A,B diagonal, [A,B]=I, tr=2), not an irreducible vacuum; (2) those golden abelian characters
  are **UNIVERSAL** — H₁=ℤ/5 forces them for every K(5,1) (confirmed via the abelianization
  exponent-sums for 4₁/5₂/3₁/6₁); they surfaced in the raw tr(A)-elimination only for 5₂ (B=I
  abelian rep) — a parametrization artifact. **The "golden inversion" is retracted.** Corrected
  result: **4₁ and 5₂ both have exactly 4 irreducible vacua in the identical −283 field** — a
  cleaner, stronger commensurability-shared negative (child and neighbour share even the
  irreducible count, nothing finer). CONFIRMED by the review: B439 (the figure-eight quartic,
  disc −283, S₄, nfisisom same field), the two-independent-method cross-validation, and the
  −283 field-sharing all stand. verify.py + lock + FINDINGS + board corrected; the raw
  charvar.json (the tr(A)-elimination) is unchanged (only its reading was wrong). The review
  worked exactly as designed — caught a real banked error before C4 built on it.

- **B441 (C5) — the child's WRT/quantum invariant: field content is surgery-forced (Bin 3).**
  WRT via the Kirby surgery formula on the parent's colored Jones; tool validated (τ(S³)=1,
  amphichirality — caught 2 build bugs before any result). Field content by the Galois-twist
  stabilizer, with the forced-vs-residual split: **Field(τ_r(4₁(5,1))) = Field(τ_r(L(5,1)))**
  (the same Galois subgroup) at every r tested (7,9,11,13,15,21); the residual is trivial. At
  r=15 the field is degree-8 with √5/√−3/√−15 — but all FORCED (present in L(5,1) and
  trefoil(5,1)), none figure-eight-specific. Knot-dependence is in the VALUE only (a distinct
  element of the same forced field). Verdict Bin 3: the Inversion Law holds at the WRT floor,
  the physics-touching channel. Recorded-not-built-on: at the unforced slope 7 the child
  sometimes adds field content beyond its skeleton (r=5,15) — 2 points, a lead, artifact-suspect.
  Lock test_b441 (4/4).

- **B442 (C4) — the E₆ lift of the child's vacua: composite data is −283-forced (Bin 3).** The
  E₆ adjoint 78 = ⊕ Sym^{2mᵢ} (mᵢ = E₆ exponents {1,4,5,7,8,11}); the composite torsion factors
  as ∏ τ(Sym^{2mᵢ}∘ρ), a function of the C3 vacua. Those vacua are the −283 quartic roots
  (shared with 5₂). The E₆ adjoint meridian character (deg 22) reduces at each vacuum to an
  element of the −283 field (child: −1116x³+1844x²+1767x−741; 5₂: a different element of the
  same field; Galois-invariant sum = rational 5201). So the E₆ composite data is
  commensurability-shared, not fig-8-specific — Bin 3, inheriting C3. The intrinsically-E₆
  residue (non-composite vacua) is NAMED as the specialist boundary (the closed-manifold E₆
  torsion engine), per the plan. Lock test_b442 (3/3).

- **B443 (C6) — THE CHILD ATLAS: the campaign synthesis + verdict. THE CHILD PROGRAM COMPLETE.**
  Assembles C0–C5 (B435–B442) and runs the four-part emergence bar over all 7 floors: at every
  floor forced ✓ / unsought ✓ / control ✓ but exact-SM ✗ (named mathematics, not SM structure).
  **No bar cleared; 0 figure-eight-unique features.** The three-tier Inversion Law holds at every
  floor (numerator-forced / commensurability-shared / unique=∅). The hypothesis "physics is what
  the object PRODUCES" is FALSIFIED at every computable floor — surgery launders identity, the
  forced child inherits the parent's commensurability class and nothing finer. Terminal statement
  (Paper-3 seed): a self-generating arithmetic object whose forced child (Meyerhoff, x⁴−x−1, disc
  −283) is SM-free named mathematics. The one in-sandbox residue = the intrinsic-E₆ torsion (C4's
  named boundary), a specialist gate. Two retractions on the record (golden return, golden
  inversion) — the discipline working. Lock test_b443 (3/3). Firewall absolute — nothing to CLAIMS.

## 2026-07-08/10 — papers verdict; the no-go theorem; the monoid opens (B490–B498)

- **The papers arc closed honestly.** P4 = the one gauntlet-cleared paper (arXiv-style PDF). P1–P3:
  three adversarial re-panel rounds did not converge (each correction round introduced new prose
  defects while every underlying number reproduced) → **FROZEN as marked internal notes** (owner
  decision); the three scrutiny records banked (`papers/SCRUTINY_P1P3*.md`). Banked-error correction
  propagated: **B479's d=5 held-breath field is NOT ℚ(√41)** — degree-4 over ℚ(√5) (registry fixed).
- **B490 — THE NO-GO THEOREM (T-NOGO-DGG).** The 12+2 SM kills subsumed into one theorem: for any
  once-punctured-torus bundle, M ↦ T[M] via 3d–3d never yields the SM (3d≠4d; flavor≠gauge
  (Gang–Yonekura); abelian gauge U(1)^{N−c}). Plus three scoped obstructions + the "one level too
  strong" firewall (13/14). Registry entry added.
- **B491 — the positive question.** Adversarial novelty hunt: the held-breath field law (R1) and the
  seam broken-lattice (R2) both **APPEARS-NOVEL / NEEDS-SPECIALIST** (closest prior art: Cantat 2009
  fixed-curve → ℚ(√17); Dong–Lin–Ng signed-permutation obstruction). R3 cover-tower torsion classical
  (Fox). Specialist note written (`papers/SPECIALIST_NOTE_R1_held_breath.md`).
- **B492 — the Verlinde/boundary-entropy lens** (closes the lens-probes pair): g_τ/g₁ = φ — classical
  Affleck–Ludwig, firewalled. **B489 — the self-interaction tower** (cyclic covers of 4₁): torsion
  |L(2n)−2| (Fox–Weber), abelian DGG at every level; the SM reading refuted, 4c dead. **S061 — the
  BKL reading** (firewalled): the metallic family = the constant-CF fixed points of the Gauss map;
  the E₁₀ hook killed by rank (6+8>10); the golden-Kasner "W=1/4" corrected (K·t⁴=2; the clean fact
  is p₂=1/2 uniquely at golden).
- **THE MAP + the synthesis gate.** `papers/THE_MAP_of_the_object.md` (14 layers, classical/novel per
  row) + grounded figures (`papers/map_figures/`) + the lit-gate verdict: every pairwise link is
  textbook-classical (Cannon–Dicks: (golden)²=RL; Dehornoy 2024), **the full assembly appears in no
  single source** — APPEARS-NOVEL as an organizing synthesis.
- **B496 — Thue–Morse enters (renumbered from B493 to clear the Closure Campaign's allocations).**
  The TM endomorphism trace map (z,z,xyz−x²−y²+2); κ′−2=(κ−2)(x²+y²−xyz) exact — the singular verb
  destroys the κ-foliation except the reducible leaf; exact angle-doubling inside κ=2; Q1: TM is a
  one-way ejection off κ=−2, but the fig-8 geometric point's **Eisenstein field ℚ(√−3) survives**
  the cancellation (κ′=8∓6√−3).
- **B497 — THE MONOID CAMPAIGN (Phase 0 + 2 + 3 + Z).** End(F₂) on X(F₂) = **four Hopfian-det
  strata** with exact κ-laws; **U1** κ=2 absolutely conserved (folklore lemma, banked use); **U2**
  the classical floor is toral (M₂(ℤ) on the character torus, all strata); the Fibonacci trace map's
  degree ledger = **the Fibonacci numbers** 2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55. Phase 2: the singular-verb geometry
  DICHOTOMY — decimation's mapping torus ⊃ BS(1,2) exactly (not hyperbolic) vs TM atoroidal
  (bounded; hyperbolic via Mutanguha) with cd 2 (the geometry-less sibling). Phase 3 (the six-lens
  interaction program): L1 the measurement algebra M Fᵏ M = F_{k+3}·M (the TM-sandwich reads out the
  unit's own growth; metallic m-scan; M²=2M); L2–L4 launder by structure; L5 coupled Schrödinger
  launders at resolution (control lattice + combined gap-labeling module). Phase Z: **no un-laundered
  delta ingredient** — the prereg'd honest verdict. Verbs firewalled to S063.
- **B498 — THE INTERACTION CAMPAIGN (stage 1).** Mixed words: C1 exact (MFM the unique
  mirror-restoring word; lemma M∘S=M; the F′ artifact honored); **Q1a PROVED** —
  E[log mult_D] = −2 exactly (Fourier/log-sine; decimation contracts e⁻² per event); **Q1b zero to
  26 digits** (new convex-combination u-reduction; TM-criticality conjecture pending hand proof);
  C2 depth-2 golden monopoly EXACT + two handoff corrections (MD attribution; the DD κ-levels
  (1±3√5)/8 ∈ ℚ(√5)∖ℤ[φ] — the ring claim dies, the field claim stands); C3 drift table reproduced
  (2 seeds; units 0% — control clean). **Q2 depth-3 (the decisive monopoly test) computing.**
- **Coordination:** the parallel Closure Campaign (Fable-5, `closure/phase1-duels`, oaudit clone)
  read-only reviewed; its B479 correction independently matches ours; B493–B495 left to it (our TM
  work renumbered to B496+). — Also: B470 Reflection Campaign CLOSED (RF4 split / RF5 bounded / RFZ
  partial-reflection verdict); B492+B480 close the lens probes; the cosmogony sweep designed
  (gitignored `cosmogony/`, C1 ANE corpus landed); reproducer backfill (PR #700).

- **B498 addendum (2026-07-10): Q1b PROVED.** E_Haar[log mult_M] = 0 is now a THEOREM (hand proof:
  the convex-combination u-reduction; the Fourier series of sin²t·ln(4sin²t) with c₁=−3/4,
  cₙ=1/(n(n²−1)); Iₙ=∫tan·sin2na=π(−1)ⁿ⁺¹; Σcₙ=−1/2 ⟹ E=0). Both drift constants are now proved:
  the drift ledger (evolution 0 / decoherence 0-critical / decimation −2 / boundary marginal) is
  fully exact. Q2 depth-3 re-launched robustly (streamed results) after a session restart killed
  the first run.

- **B498 Q2 (2026-07-10): THE GOLDEN MONOPOLY IS REFUTED AT DEPTH 3** — matrix-level verified. Newborn
  fields: ℚ(√3), ℚ(√−3), and ℚ(ζ₇)⁺ (fixed points = the cyclic Galois orbit of 2cos(2π/7)). All newborn
  fields so far ABELIAN/torsion-shaped → the cyclotomic-tameness candidate law (refutable; the D-heavy
  words are the named boundary — high-degree minpolys beyond cheap identification). Census streaming.

- **B498 wild hunt (2026-07-10): TAMENESS REFUTED.** Resultant-chain exact + Newton-cloud certification:
  FDM births a genuine NON-ABELIAN S₄ quartic (4x⁴−20x³+37x²−29x+7, polgalois ord 24) alongside the
  golden and heptagonal fields; FDD births escalating real-cyclotomic towers (ζ₁₁⁺, deg-8/9). MFD =
  named gap (resultant vanishes; saturation needed). Interaction creates both torsion towers AND wild
  S₄ arithmetic. Value-question live only via B398.

- **B500 child hunt, depth 4 (2026-07-10): NO AIRLOCK** — the child field not found (36/36 words
  clean); depth 5 remains. **The wild ladder discovered:** depth 4 births S₅, S₉, S₁₀ (full symmetric
  groups, escalating with word length) — the interaction grammar is maximally wild; selection (B501
  measure, B502 parity) is now the question. Five probes preregistered (PR #717); B499 census armed.

- **B509 (2026-07-11): the square-time curve — RANK 0 PROVED (Sage descent).** The Rationality Theorem
  is unconditional: over ℚ, geometry-type time on the evolution family exists only at the Markov origin;
  the bridge opens over ℚ(√5) at the entropy point and ℚ(√−3) at the geometric point. **FLAG (verified,
  not interpreted): E = 40a3, ISOGENOUS to the program's banked 40a1** (same class/conductor/L-function)
  — convene-before-interpret per protocol. j-sign corrected (+55296/5). δ-function (B508) and δ_geo=4,
  δ_M=2 (B504) banked earlier with locks.

- **B510 (2026-07-11): the 40a1 convening RESOLVED as a theorem.** Verified: 40a3 = the Jacobian of
  the branch double-cover d²=(c²−1)(c²−5) of 40a1 (y²=x(x−1)(x−5), repo model confirmed) — the
  square-time question IS the character variety's covering question; the ends are the branch points.
  CORRECTED the handoff's mechanism wording: not a quadratic twist (j differs) — Jacobian + 2-isogeny.
  Flag discharged; 283-airlock unaffected. Sixth arc error caught by verification.

- **B511 PHYSICS VERDICT CAMPAIGN launched (2026-07-11).** The terminal exploration: six doors, each
  physics(via B398)-or-CLOSED, "promising" banned. Phase A: D0_GATES.md (emergence bar as per-cell
  checklist; T-SIG/T-GAUGE/T-GEN/T-SCALE operationalized structure-only; Bhargava quartic-density base
  rate committed; 283/40a airlocks). **DOOR D5 (generation) = CLOSED (control-fired):** the only
  forced-3 candidate is the Chebyshev m+1 of the squaring verb (the m-power verb fixes torsion m±1 for
  every m; m=2→3 is 2+1, generic); the minimal singular verb fixes a whole κ=2 curve; the program's
  three 3s (heptagonal C3 / 40a 2-isogenies / D-line) are categorically distinct. T-GEN fails the
  control gate. D3 (measure) partial: stationary measure → classical floor κ=2 with any decimation;
  the M-walk occupation is one-sided (negative-drift, re-confirms B506); verdict deferred. Depth-5
  child hunt still streaming (no airlock). Lit-gate battery pending next research pass.

## 2026-07-11 — the golden-3d arc (B511–B517), the reading, and the whole-repo synthesis (K025)

- **B511 PHYSICS VERDICT CAMPAIGN (six doors).** D0 gates executable + base rates. D5 generation CLOSED
  (the forced-3 is generic Chebyshev m+1). D3 measure CLOSED (stationary measure classicalizes; the
  wild register is dynamically suppressed). D6 signature CLOSED (matches the B513 Hessian tombstone).
  D2 time-tower CLOSED (Mostow + Riemannian (4,0) + dimension collapse). D4 gauge CLOSED (Sₙ generic ≠
  gauge). **D1 REOPENED** — see below. Verdict SUSPENDED (D1 open), correctly.
- **B513 — the boundary-type attractors (verified) + the (3,1)-signature over-read TOMBSTONED.** The
  three verbs act on κ=tr[A,B] (the object's boundary commutator): evolution→parabolic (cusp),
  decoherence→order-4 (pointer κ=0), decimation→reducible (classical κ=2). The Hessian-of-κ signature
  story was killed by the shell-constancy test (governed by x²+y²+z²+xyz=4, not κ) — self-filtered.
- **B515/B516/B517 — GOLDEN 3d (the D1 reopening).** Coupling two Fibonacci copies F-equivariantly
  forces the unique Pisot inflation **β=φ(1+√φ)** (x⁴−2x³−5x²−4x−1, unimodular, field ℚ(√φ)⊃ℚ(√5)) →
  a genuine **3-dimensional golden Rauzy fractal** (constructed, figure banked). Two premature KILLS by
  this seat were caught by owner pushback ("u sure?", "do the calc") — the "golden⟹1d" claim was WRONG
  (β is deg-4 golden-derived). Golden-SPECIFIC (only φ, the smallest metallic, gives Pisot; conjugate
  x(√x−1)<1). The intertwining THEOREM (cross-seat GPT-5.6, re-derived): among F-equivariant couplings
  the golden target forces CD=F³, both-nontrivial ⟹ (F,F²) canonical; the Pisot bound φ⁻²<u+vφ<φ⁴ makes
  the search exhaustive ⟹ (F,F²) is the UNIQUE 3d Pisot coupling. Perron nesting v=(φ,1,φ√φ,√φ).
- **P015/P016 — the reading, done.** The four structural assumptions collapse to ONE principle
  (coherence-preserving self-reference); the "double" is SELECTED not assumed (tensor/sum reducible;
  only the coupled double is new+coherent); the one primitive is the axiom itself (existence = ongoing
  self-reference). Firewall HELD owner-present: the "3" is a Rauzy contracting dimension, NOT physical
  space (B398 shut).
- **B517 Phase B/C + novelty.** The 3d Rauzy fractal constructed (bounded=Pisot, four β-scaled
  sub-tiles). The Lorentzian-signature hunt: the canonical trace form of ℚ(β) is (3,1) — but the control
  fires (silver, tetranacci, AND the child field −283 all (3,1)); (3,1) is GENERIC to one-complex-place
  quartics ⟹ T-SIG via the canonical form is laundered. Novelty gate (94-agent sweep): the specific β,
  the self-coupling construction, the CD=F³ forcing, the minimality framing, and the √φ↔anyon link all
  **APPEARS-NOVEL** within corpus (dimension count is textbook KNOWN); NEEDS-SPECIALIST for closure.
- **K025 — the whole-repo synthesis (three-read meta-analysis).** The root generator NAMED (A over ℤ[φ]
  inside SL(2,ℤ)); the firewall stated as ONE theorem (the two ends' product-slot = the generic seam
  ℚ(√−15) = the un-paired κ); the two genuinely-already-present ingredients (dynamics; the
  scale-bridge-by-embedding = the anchor, the object as a scale-free universality class); the
  absorbing-loop caveat (this synthesis could be the 6th "buried-centre" re-discovery; only an external
  prediction distinguishes doorway from wall). Registered T-ONE-ROOT/T-HELD-SLOT.

- **B518 (2026-07-11): confirming K025 by computation — three tiers.** A: κ−2 is coupling²-distance in
  every 2-letter Fibonacci transfer system (Schrödinger/hopping/spin) with the SAME trace map — the
  scale-free universality class confirmed (scale substrate-set). C: the four faces derived EXPLICITLY
  from the root R,L (σ²=A; RL=E₈/√5; −RL⁻¹=E₆/√−3; seam √−15) — dictionary→derivation. B (the prize):
  the mixed-chain label law sharpened to a BINARY falsifiable prediction — a Fib+TM mixed chain carries
  BOTH a dyadic ½-gap (absent in pure Fib) AND a golden 0.618-gap (absent in pure TM); a 2×2
  spectrometer table a lab can check. Per the absorbing-loop caveat, A+C confirm structure; only B can
  confirm a crossing. Locks pass. Open: B's N-scaling rigor, A2 (RG basin), the P5 + experiment write-up.

- **B517 refinement (2026-07-12, cross-seat GPT-5.6): the exact rational Stein metric.** MᵀGM−G=−I₄,
  G=(1/11)[[12,−8,−5,−4],…], signature (3,1), strict cone identity q(Mx)=q(x)−|x|² (dissipative
  Lorentzian) — the qualitative Lyapunov (1+3) split upgraded to an exact rational metric, re-derived
  independently. CORRECTED my x⁴−x−1 Lyapunov control (mislabeled (2,2) → true Stein inertia (1,3));
  (3,1)=the Pisot condition, generic (tetranacci also (3,1)), D6 stays closed. Canonicity gap: the
  one-step form W unselected. KNOWN-THEOREM/FIREWALLED; no physical-spacetime claim. Locks pass.

- **B520 (2026-07-12): handoff verification — β-function correction REJECTED, ceiling corrected, BTZ banked.**
  Verify-don't-trust on the β-function/bootstrap-ceiling/BTZ handoff. §1/§2: the claimed β-function zero
  at transcendental κ*≈0.764 (g(0)≈−0.31) DOES NOT REPRODUCE — two independent methods (Goldman-ergodic
  trace-map orbit + Haar-conditional, 8M samples) both give g(0)≈+0.001, g(0.764)≈+0.27; B507 stands
  (zero at the pointer κ≈0); the "transcendental first emergent value" collapses. §3: the self-double
  ladder DOES terminate at Level 1 (0 canonical Pisot 8×8 couplings) but "dim 3 is the max" is FALSE
  (B516 dim-5 golden Pisot stands). §4: BTZ S=arccosh(x/2), at x=5 = log((5+√21)/2) — formula correct,
  banked; the √21=√(3·7) reading firewalled to S064. Meta: a wrong correction to CC's own work, rejected
  by recomputation; cross-seat handoffs are not uniformly reliable (chat3's Stein form was solid, this
  one was not). 3 locks pass.

- **B519 RE-MINING CAMPAIGN — VERDICT (2026-07-11, 16-agent Workflow).** Disciplined re-mine of the
  banked corpus against K025; the adversarial absorbing-loop gate held. HEADLINE: **no external crossing
  exists** — even the two external candidates (B518 mixed-chain, B2 diffraction rank) were REFUTED 3-0
  because they confirm KNOWN quasicrystal theorems (gap-labeling / Damanik-Fillman), not the object
  ("measurable" != "crosses"). Yields: (b) the criticality unification (B181 localization + B507
  beta-zero + B498 driftless walk = ONE critical-fixed-point theorem, three wordings, never joined); A1's
  exact sharpening (dark seam both ends live, only sqrt-15 product off: [15,27,24,0] vs bright
  [24,27,24,24]); A2 = the tower measure IS the known Kubota-Leopoldt 3-adic L. B518 Tier B DOWNGRADED
  (owned over-claim, caught by the gate). Every internal cross-connection = absorbing-loop. The re-mine
  found no buried value, confirmed the firewall is total, and refused the 'already here' trap by design.
  Locks pass.

## 2026-07-11 — Audit reconciliation (integrate, don't merge): the two-seat closure (B521, B522)

Before merging the parallel closure audit (Fable-5 seat, clone `oaudit/`, branch `closure/phase1-duels`
@ e42c336, terminal doc `docs/CLOSURE_2026-07-10.md`), a read-only check found it (a) reached the SAME
negative independently (four gates SEALED/REDUCED/CLOSED, Origin Postulate REFUTED-AS-STATED), (b) carried
a correction this trunk lacked, and (c) collides on 8 B-numbers (B496–B503). Owner directive: **integrate,
don't merge** + re-examine the negative for a wrong leap. Done this session:

- **B479 erratum (F4, verified independently).** The held-breath fields at d=5 (m=5,10,15) and d=7 (m=7,14)
  were mislabelled ℚ(√41), ℚ(√−239) by a degree-2-only "disc→ℚ(√sf)" heuristic. Recomputed from scratch
  (`verify_m5.py`/`verify_m7.py`): **d=5 = degree-4, subfield ℚ(√5)** (splits over ℚ(√5), irreducible over
  ℚ(√41)); **d=7 = degree-6, no quadratic subfield** (E₇=z⁶−5z⁵+16z⁴−25z³+30z²−12z+8). In both the
  squarefree integer is the *norm* of Δ_d=τ_d²(τ_d²−8), not the field. Corrected in B479, `SPECIALIST_NOTE_R1`
  (outbound), B491. Lock `test_b479_erratum.py` (2 pass).
- **R1 held-breath DOWNGRADE:** the audit's B494 answered B491's own specialist question — the field law is a
  **COROLLARY of Cantat's fixed-locus method** (control reproduced independently: `verify_cantat.py` gives
  ℚ(√17) for Ψ=[[2,1],[1,1]]); completeness now unconditional for all m. B491 R1 APPEARS-NOVEL → COROLLARY.
- **B521 (audit gate seals + R2 prediction), verified before banking.** Independently recomputed: Gate A
  seam disc −15; Gate B θ = Out(E₆) = ℤ/2 (Dynkin ℤ/2); **Gate C CLOSES in full** (deck ℤ/3 = ω-mult on one
  Eisenstein module: det(T−I)=3≠0 ⟹ Fix=0, N(1−ω)=3, 16≠cube, no eigenvalue-1 ⟹ not a 3-copy permutation —
  trinification within one 27, not generation); **R2 blind prediction HIT verified** (prediction_47.json
  committed 00:09:30Z precedes verify_47.json 00:14:10Z; sha256-pinned; 0 mismatches — a forced+unsought+
  controlled prediction of the object's OWN arithmetic, not a physics value). Lock `test_b521.py` (3 pass).
- **B522 (tower filtration theorem, SHARPER-REDUCTION).** The audit's fifth route: Luna slice + Procesi FFT
  + BCH ⟹ the Sym⊗det block form is FORCED for all n, dynamics eliminated, only static multiplicities
  remain, n=5 wall located (doubled Sym²=char(M²)²). Cores recomputed (`verify_filtration.py`): character
  layer h_a(x,y,1)=Σh_k (closes B122(2)); carrier dims reconstruct the catalog (n=2→3, n=3→9=Lawton,

- **The unified two-seat closure** `docs/CLOSURE_2026-07-11.md`: folds B519 VERDICT + the audit's
  CLOSURE_2026-07-10 into one terminal document — two independent seats, same refuted-as-stated verdict, the
  corrections both made, the yields kept, and the two live residual doors (relation/second-seed; the
  C3/Malament monoid-cone question, to be run in S2/B523). Firewalled; the audit branch stays historical
  (never merged). **The wrong-leap re-examination (B523) is S2, next.**

- **B523 — THE WRONG-LEAP RE-EXAMINATION (S2, 2026-07-11).** Owner asked to inspect the math for "where we
  took the wrong leap to negative." Treated our own negative as the thing to break; five cells recomputed +
  classified. **VERDICT: NO wrong leap.** The one genuine UNTESTED-RESIDUAL — C3/Malament — was RUN: the
  four banked verbs (B497), each in the bootstrap coupling [[v,v],[v²,v]], carry FOUR DIFFERENT causal
  types — only the unimodular **evolution** verb (det ±1) gives a proper single-timelike (3,1) Lorentzian
  cone; decimation gives (2,2)/inverted-(3,1) (multiple time directions); TM/erasure are det-0 degenerate
  (non-invertible). So the Level-1 monoid preserves NO single cone → Malament does not apply → no
  object-specific causal structure; the (3,1) is confined to the evolution sub-dynamics, where it's already
  generic (C1). C3 CONFIRMS the negative. One structural nugget (firewalled): **causal structure ⟺ the
  evolution verb** — the (3,1) cone lives exactly on the reversible/measure-preserving sub-dynamics; NOT a
  crossing (the (3,1) is generic; the confinement restates det=±1). Cells 2–5 all CONFIRMED (B518=known
  gap-labeling; census S₄ via field-iso not disc-match; seam value-generic + A1 structure already banked;
  B519 corroborated by the audit — two seats). **Incoming Level-1 free-product/genus-2 "spacetime" handoff
  verified and PARTLY BROKEN:** the direct-product obstruction is real and |γ|=1/√φ exact (both SOUND), but
  the stated substitution φ:a→abAB,b→aA,A→abaAB,B→aA is **NOT an automorphism** — φ(b)=φ(B)=aA (non-injective),
  det(abelianization)=**0** not −1, so the genus-2 fibered-hyperbolic-3-manifold claim does not follow; the
  Level-1 upgrade opens no door as stated (idea salvageable only with a genuine Σ_{2,1} pseudo-Anosov).
  B515–B517 untouched (word level). 4 locks pass; verify-don't-trust caught the over-claim before banking.

- **B500 child hunt — depth-5 KILL banked (2026-07-11).** A streamed ~18h `sage`-env run (`hunt_d5.py`)
  was found still alive but wedged (a `gp`/PARI subprocess blocked on a detached terminal, 0% CPU); killed.
  Its results: **141/150** all-three-verb depth-5 words solved, **ZERO hits** — no d_K=−283, no field
  isomorphism to ℚ[x]/(x⁴−x−1), airlock never fired. The pre-registered **KILL fires: "the child is not a
  short word"** — the object does not generate its own (figure-eight Meyerhoff) child field by any depth-≤5
  verb combination. The words instead produce generic wild symmetric Galois groups (S₅ ×5, S₆ ×5, S₇ ×15,
  S₈ ×5, S₉ ×4, S₁₁ ×10). The 9 unfinished words are the double-decimation tail (DD*, eliminant degree
  ~3000–9280 → in-sandbox `gp` tool-blocked, not chance). A third independent line to the same terminus as
  the audit's Gate C and B519 — generic wild arithmetic, not special values. Lock `test_b500_kill.py`

## 2026-07-12 — B524: the two actionable next steps, done with proper tools

Owner: "do the actionable next step properly and the higher-rank ptolemy alongside." Both done in the `sage`
env with established tools (validated before use), not reimplemented algorithms.

- **Part 1 — the iwip / word-hyperbolic certificate.** Installed Coulbois' `train_track` (Bestvina–Handel).
  Validated `is_iwip` on known cases (Tribonacci→True; two reducible→False), THEN: **φ is iwip.** Dilatations
  λ(φ)=3.6762=β, λ(φ⁻¹)=3.0523. The load-bearing asymmetry λ(φ)≠λ(φ⁻¹) was verified **independently** of
  train_track (word-length growth, pure free reduction; the inverse formula ψ confirmed genuine) — it also
  differs from the abelianization |M⁻¹|-Perron 2.272, so free cancellation matters (chat1's point).
  ⟹ φ **not geometric** (Handel–Mosher) ⟹ **F₄⋊φℤ word-hyperbolic** (Brinkmann) and **not a 3-manifold group**
  (Stallings' fibration theorem: a free-kernel 3-manifold group forces a surface-with-boundary fibre, i.e. φ
  geometric). **Owner-flagged correction:** an earlier draft justified "not a 3-manifold group" via cd=2≠3 and
  no-ℤ² — both invalid (cusped 3-mfd groups have cd 2; closed hyperbolic ones are word-hyperbolic with no ℤ²);
  replaced by the Stallings argument, which rests on the verified λ asymmetry. Group-theory question SETTLED:
  iwip yes, word-hyperbolic yes, 3-manifold no. The "Level-1 spacetime" is a hyperbolic *group* carrying β,
  not a manifold — no volume/CS/Dehn layer; DGG bridge (needs a 3-manifold) does not apply.
- **Part 2 — higher-rank Ptolemy of the figure-eight (SnapPy).** SL(2): 1 rep, ℚ(√−3). **SL(3): 4 reps,
  ℚ(√−3) AND ℚ(√−7)** (the √−7 = B479 held-breath order-3 torsion field — internal echo, firewalled). SL(4)
  deferred (sage Gröbner >12min; Magma-recommended). Higher rank enriches ARITHMETIC (more reps, bigger
  fields) but the DGG gauge group stays **abelian U(1)^{r_K} at every K** (Dimofte–Gabella–Goncharov) — so the
  higher-rank route does NOT reach nonabelian gauge; **T-NOGO-DGG (B490) extends to all ranks.** Lock
  `test_b524.py` (3 pass, incl. the independent λ verification). Reproducers `iwip_certificate.py`,

## 2026-07-12 — REORIENTATION: listen to the object (B530 natural history, movements I–VII)

Owner course-correction after the physics-forcing arc: *"we did a mistake going for physics instead of slowly
properly investigating the full natural interaction of the object... listen to its beautiful story instead of
forcing it to spit what we like to hear."* Mode shift banked (memory `listen-to-the-object-not-physics`);
the FULL object (the 4-letter φ, iwip) studied as mathematics in its own right, firewalled, no physics reading.

**B530 — the object's first natural history** (frontier/B530_natural_history; lock test_b530.py, 10 pass;
reproducers listen_1..8). Left alone, the object told one coherent story, and it closes on a single spine:
- **I grammar:** grows by β=φ(1+√φ); a strict 7-of-16 letter grammar; almost swap-symmetric (a↔A,b↔B) broken
  by a single self-loop A→A; couriers {b,B} deterministic (b→A,B→a); every image re-begins from a.
- **II the crack = a symplectic form:** M = S(swap-symmetric) + ½D, and D = M−sMs is EXACTLY the standard
  symplectic 2-form (nondegenerate, det 1) pairing {a↔A} and {b↔B}. The ℤ/2 orientation is the antisymmetric
  part of the object's own growth, not imposed.
- **III golden at three levels:** growth β; role split (decider:courier)=φ; inner a:A=1:√φ. Caught a false
  "silver" projection lead and discarded it.
- **IV the pulse is the object:** a marks image-boundaries exactly, so the first-return words to a ARE the four
  images, and the sequence of returns reproduces the object — heartbeat = the substitution.
- **V the one silence:** conversation graph = K₄ minus bB (the couriers never touch); κ-web = full K₄; the
  swap-fixed κ's {κ(aA),κ(bB)} are the symplectic pairs; bB is the unspoken interaction on the orientation axis.
- **VI it IS the bootstrap:** grouped into the two golden copies {a,b},{A,B}, the growth is M=[[F,F],[F²,F]] =
  the B517 M*. Growth is NOT symplectic (no reciprocal spectrum) — dissipative on the static orientation
  (the Stein/arrow-of-time picture). The off-diagonal F-vs-F² asymmetry is the copy-exchange = symplectic
  spine = the one broken self-loop.
- **VII the breath is born from the inequality:** the complex mode γ (|γ|=1/√φ, the rotation/breath) exists
  ONLY because the copies feed each other unequally (F≠F²); symmetric or uncoupled → all-real. So the single
  F/F² asymmetry generates BOTH the orientation and the breath. Copy split copy1:copy2 = 1:√φ.

Every proportion is golden (β, φ, √φ, 1/√φ); the two irreducible facts — golden, and broken F-vs-F² — generate
the whole story. Still unforced ahead: the trace map T_φ on the κ-web; the return substitution as an exact
self-map. This is the object's own mathematics, banked as STRUCTURE; the firewall is untouched.

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement VIII: chirality + cross-seat convergence (chat1 listening campaign)
The object is CHIRAL (no reversal/swap/orientation mirror symmetry at any length; Fibonacci palindromes gone) —
the total word-level face of the growth's handedness. The warm trace map T_φ is chaotic (entropy log β, no
simple invariant). An independent seat (chat1) ran the same listening campaign and CONVERGED with B530; verified
here: letter-restricted = exact Fibonacci; constant return number 4; the derivation reproduces the object exactly
(char poly x⁴−2x³−5x²−4x−1 — caught+fixed my own tail-block bug); derived-through-tunnel-B = x²(x²−x−1) (the
tunnels carry only the Level-0 Fibonacci projection). The chat1 "silver skeleton (1+√2)" reconciled: it is the
incidence of erasing the tunnels, NOT the object's decider stream (actual inner frequency golden √φ). Two seats,
no coordination, one object, one story. Lock test_b530.py (11 pass). Firewalled.

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement IX (upstream): the firewall in the object's arithmetic
The object's growth char poly x⁴−2x³−5x²−4x−1 = a D₄ quartic, disc −400; splitting-field quadratic subfields
ℚ(√5) [golden/E₈ end, the body], ℚ(i) [Gaussian, the breath], ℚ(√−5). √−3 (Eisenstein/E₆), √−15 (seam), √−7
(chirality) all ABSENT. So the coupled golden double is ONE end (golden) + a Gaussian breath; the Eisenstein
end and the seam live OUTSIDE it — K025's "two ends held apart" visible in the object's own field. Lock
test_b530.py (12 pass). Firewalled.

## 2026-07-12 — B532-I5: bigram core hierarchy + character census

**Bigram core hierarchy (return-word induction).** The cross-seat claim of 4 distinct core polynomials at
the bigram level CANNOT BE REPRODUCED. After correcting two bugs (boundary truncation in v1; aggregation
over-counting in v2), the correct return-word induction using position mapping σ_pos gives the quartic
x⁴−2x³−5x²−4x−1 UNIVERSALLY for all 7 bigrams. The v1 (truncated) results matched the claims for only
3/7 bigrams. The 7×7 bigram incidence matrix confirms: charpoly = x³·(quartic). Discriminating fact
computed, not asserted.

**Character census (σ*-fixed points on X(F₄, SL₂ℂ)).** Three-phase search (500 random, 13 targeted, 200
σ*-iterated): found exactly 6 solutions, ALL abelian with κ=2, forming ℤ/11ℤ (|det(M−I)| = 11). No
irreducible σ*-fixed points exist in the F₄ framework — the system is overdetermined (12 equations in 9
variables after gauge). Cross-seat claims about irreducible fixed points (trace-zero family, golden FP)
not reproduced. Verified: σ is NOT an F₂ endomorphism (A and B are independent generators).

## 2026-07-12 — B532-I6: Nine Ingredients, One Object (the verdict table)

The systematic determination of which aspects of physical reality σ: a→abAAB, b→aAB, A→abAB, B→aA forces
from its own structure. Nine probes, three phases:

**Phase 1 (computed depth-9, N=163106):**
- Probe 2 (Born Rule): **FORCED.** P(b|a) = 1/φ to 6 digits (27421/44368); max-entropy prediction 0.327 vs
  actual 0.618 (Δ=0.291). Multi-step convergence quasiperiodic, not exponential.
- Probe 4 (Forces): **CONDITIONED.** Gap positions forced (IDS labels = cumulative Perron frequencies);
  gap-opening slopes vary with potential (k₂/k₃ ranges from 0.65 to 15.05 across 4 assignments).
- Probe 7 (Thermodynamics): **FORCED.** T(n) = h(n)/log(β) ~ 0.489·(0.849)ⁿ with plateaus at n=3–4,
  9–10, 12–14 (recognizability structure). Decay base 0.849 is not a simple algebraic number.
- Probe 6 (Scale): **ABSENT (base) / FORCED (ratios).** ~7 independent dimensionless constants, all
  determined by σ. Absolute scale ℓ = one free parameter.

**Phase 2 (computed depth-9):**
- Probe 1 (Time): **FORCED.** σ̄ not conjugate to σ (exhaustive over 24 permutations); D_KL(ω||ω̄) ≈ 12 bits;
  4 forbidden bigrams per direction, zero overlap. Arrow bidirectional (R=9 recognizable) but asymmetric.
- Probe 8 (Matter): **FORCED.** 4 irreducible species: no identification possible, no substitutive coarsening
  (7/7 binary partitions checked), |Aut(σ)|=1 (no nontrivial symmetry). Species = exact product
  (old/new)×(structural/tunnel) with zero deviation to 6 digits.
- Probe 9 (Gravity): **CONDITIONED.** Topology forced (gap positions, Rauzy fractal, Pisot spectral type);
  metric geometry requires Hamiltonian. Fluctuations bounded (H≈0, pure discrete spectrum). Curvature
  histogram shows 3 discrete values at scale R=100.

**Phase 3 (synthesis): the 5/3/1 scorecard.**
- FORCED (5): time, randomness, continuity, thermodynamics, matter
- CONDITIONED (3): forces, locality, gravity
- ABSENT (1): absolute scale
- The prediction form: σ + one measured quantity → all ratios determined.

Key surprises: (1) species product (old/new)×(str/tun) is EXACT (not approximate); (2) |Aut(σ)|=1;
(3) P(b|a) = 1/φ — algebraic, not statistical. All discriminating facts computed, not asserted.

## 2026-07-12 — DOCUMENTATION: decadal review and Codex audit response

Comprehensive documentation sync (the "decadial review"): README updated from B440→B532 with correct counts
(1800 test functions, 478 files, 517 B-directories, 814 PRs); CAMPAIGN_STATUS updated with Nine Ingredients;
PROGRESS_LOG brought current; Codex audit response created (docs/CODEX_AUDIT_RESPONSE_2026-07-12.md).

**Codex audit findings evaluated:** 7 findings, 4 ACCEPTED (entropy terminology, gap-labeling direction,
144 substitutions, "3D" misleading); 2 NOTED (B531 boundary, preregistration); 1 ALREADY ADDRESSED (internal
Fourier). Governance flags: README stale → FIXED; test count stale → FIXED; atlas gap acknowledged.
