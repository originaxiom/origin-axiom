## 2026-01-07 – Rung 0: Phase 4 contract skeleton (draft)

- Created `phase4/SCOPE.md` describing the draft mission of Phase 4:
  vacuum→FRW consistency and scale sanity tests using the Phase 3
  mechanism vacuum as the canonical anchor.
- Added draft `phase4/CLAIMS.md`, `phase4/CLAIMS_TABLE.md`,
  `phase4/NON_CLAIMS.md`, and `phase4/REPRODUCIBILITY.md`, all explicitly
  marked as **DRAFT / non-binding**.
- Established that Phase 4 must either:
  - produce at least one explicit, structurally reasonable mapping from
    \(A(\theta)\) (or a residue) to FRW/vacuum-energy-like observables
    with a non-empty corridor; **or**
  - record a structured negative result that this particular
    implementation of the Phase 3 global-amplitude mechanism fails the
    tested FRW consistency checks.
- No code, workflow, or θ-filter artifacts are introduced at this rung;
  the focus is on articulating a narrow, honest design contract for
  Phase 4 consistent with the Phase 0 architecture and the canonical
  θ/A definitions.
