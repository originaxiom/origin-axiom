# Phase 4 Non-Claims (Draft)

Status: **DRAFT – clarifying guardrails.**

Phase 4 *does not* claim:

1. **A full theory of everything.**
   - Phase 4 is a vacuum→FRW / scale sanity test, not a completed ToE.

2. **A replacement for standard cosmology.**
   - No claim to supersede ΛCDM, FRW, or mainstream treatments.
   - Any FRW-like modules here are toy constructions.

3. **A precise prediction of observed cosmological parameters.**
   - No claim to match the observed value of Ω_Λ, H_0, or other
     cosmological parameters within experimental error.

4. **Uniqueness of the mapping.**
   - Even if a viable mapping is found, Phase 4 does not claim it is
     unique or preferred by nature.

5. **Uniqueness or physical reality of the Phase 3 mechanism.**
   - Phase 4 assumes the Phase 3 vacuum model as *given* and tests its
     compatibility with FRW-like structure.
   - It does not prove that this is the only or physically correct
     implementation of the Origin Axiom.

6. **Any statement about θ\_* as a proven constant of nature.**
   - Phase 4 may identify corridors or candidate values, but this is
     not a claim that a particular θ\_* has been measured or derived
     as a fundamental constant.

These non-claims are intended to keep the Phase 4 narrative honest and
in line with the Phase 0 contract and the broader program philosophy.

Doc status: Draft Phase 4 non-claims (guardrails) file; clarifies what Phase 4 does not claim in its FRW toy stub role; governed by `phase4/PHASE4_ALIGNMENT_v1.md` and may be tightened in a future Phase 4 lock rung.
