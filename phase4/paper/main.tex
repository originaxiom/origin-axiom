\begin{abstract}
This Phase~4 paper takes the Phase~3 amplitude output
$\theta \mapsto A(\theta)$ as input and develops a structured,
cosmology-facing diagnostic pipeline.  The aim is not to identify a
preferred $\theta^\star$ or to claim contact with precision
cosmology, but to test whether simple mappings from $A(\theta)$ to
Friedmann--Robertson--Walker (FRW)-like quantities can be made
numerically stable and transparently interrogated.

We focus on a baseline one-parameter family of mappings,
\(
  E_{\mathrm{vac}}(\theta) = \alpha\, A(\theta)^\beta,
\)
with fixed toy parameters $(\alpha,\beta) = (1,4)$, and construct a
five-layer diagnostic stack:
(1) an $F1$ sanity curve that probes basic properties of
$E_{\mathrm{vac}}(\theta)$;
(2) $F1$ shape diagnostics that define a purely toy ``corridor''
based on simple amplitude thresholds;
(3) FRW-inspired toy checks that build $H^2(a;\theta)$ from
$E_{\mathrm{vac}}(\theta)$ and enforce basic consistency
conditions (positivity, matter era, late acceleration);
(4) a FRW viability scan that records which $\theta$ points satisfy
these toy criteria and exports a mask for further use; and
(5) a corridor-extraction step that identifies contiguous
$\theta$-bands where a given mapping passes the toy FRW checks.
On top of this, we implement a $\Lambda$CDM-like probe and a stub for an
external data probe, designed to handle the absence of bundled data
as a structured negative result rather than an implicit success.

All of these constructions are explicitly non-binding: the $F1$
mapping is not derived from fundamental physics, the resulting
corridors are diagnostic rather than canonical, and no claim is made
that any particular $\theta$ or mapping solves the cosmological
constant problem or reproduces the observed Universe.  The value of
this phase lies in providing a transparent, reproducible interface
between Phase~3 toy mechanisms and FRW-like summaries, together with
a clear scaffold that future, more physically motivated mappings or
data comparisons could use at higher rungs.
