\section{Limitations and outlook}
\label{sec:limitations}

Phase 4 is intentionally narrow in scope. Even once the mappings and
diagnostics are implemented, the phase will not claim:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a full derivation of cosmological parameters;
  \item a proof that the Origin Axiom is realised in nature; or
  \item a unique mechanism for connecting vacuum structure to FRW
        dynamics.
\end{itemize}

Instead, the goal is to provide a clean yes-or-no style test for a
specific question:

\begin{quote}
  Can the Phase 3 global-amplitude mechanism support scale-sane
  FRW-like behaviour, in at least one simple mapping family, without
  producing a degenerate or empty \(\theta\)-corridor?
\end{quote}

If the answer is ``no'' for all tested mapping families, Phase 4 will
record this as a structured negative result, signalling that either
the Phase 3 mechanism or the mapping strategy needs revision before
further unification attempts.
