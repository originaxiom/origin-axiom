\section{Mapping the Phase 3 vacuum into FRW-like observables}
\label{sec:mappings}

This section will, in later rungs, define explicit mappings from the
Phase 3 floor-enforced global amplitude \(A(\theta)\) (or a derived
residue) into:

\begin{itemize}
  \item one or more toy FRW modules; and/or
  \item simple vacuum-energy-like scalar observables.
\end{itemize}

The design goal is to keep these mappings:
\begin{itemize}
  \item simple and explicit enough to be implemented and audited;
  \item flexible enough to explore several normalisation and coupling
        choices; and
  \item constrained enough that the resulting behaviour can be turned
        into a reproducible \(\theta\)-filter, even if the outcome is
        an empty corridor.
\end{itemize}

At this rung the section serves only as a placeholder documenting the
intended role of Phase 4. No specific mapping is yet fixed or used in
claims.
