\section{Diagnostics, corridors, and failure modes}
\label{sec:diagnostics}

Later rungs will populate this section with:
\begin{itemize}
  \item diagnostics for the FRW-like or vacuum-energy-like observables
        derived from the Phase 3 mechanism;
  \item the resulting \(\theta\)-dependence and any induced corridors;
  \item explicit descriptions of non-empty, non-trivial corridors
        (if found); and
  \item structured descriptions of empty or pathological corridors,
        treated as informative negative results.
\end{itemize}

The Phase 0 ledger semantics require that Phase 4 either:
\begin{itemize}
  \item contributes a well-defined \(\theta\)-filter; or
  \item records a clearly documented failure mode that future phases
        can build on.
\end{itemize}

At this rung we do not yet present results or filters; we only
identify the role this section will play once mechanisms and
experiments are in place.
