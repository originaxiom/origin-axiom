\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Phase 4 sits between the mechanism-level vacuum work of Phase 3 and
any future attempts to build a unified picture of vacuum, matter, and
geometry. Its mission is narrow:

\begin{itemize}
  \item take the canonical Phase 3 global-amplitude mechanism and
        non-cancellation floor as given;
  \item define simple, explicit mappings from the floor-enforced
        amplitude or residue into FRW-like dynamics and
        vacuum-energy-like observables; and
  \item study the resulting behaviour of the Origin-Axiom phase
        parameter \(\theta\) in the corridor / ledger framework of
        Phase 0.
\end{itemize}

The guiding question is not whether we can reproduce the full
\(\Lambda\)CDM model or fit precise cosmological parameters, but
whether the Phase 3 mechanism can be made compatible with toy FRW
modules in a way that is numerically stable, structurally sane, and
expressible as a \(\theta\)-filter in the sense of Phase 0.

Throughout this phase we distinguish carefully between:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{binding} outputs, which may eventually define a Phase 4
        \(\theta\)-filter; and
  \item \emph{non-binding} diagnostics and figures, which serve only
        as intuition and internal checks.
\end{itemize}

The present rung does not define any concrete mappings or filters. It
only provides a minimal paper skeleton so that future rungs can add
well-documented mechanisms and experiments without restructuring the
front matter.
