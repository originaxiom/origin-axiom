\section*{Appendix B: Reproducibility notes (draft)}
\label{app:phase4_reproducibility}

This appendix will eventually document:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the Phase 4 directory and workflow structure;
  \item the gate levels (paper-only vs. paper+artifacts);
  \item the commands required to rebuild the Phase 4 paper and any
        binding \(\theta\)-filters; and
  \item the run manifests and configuration files that define the
        tested mapping families.
\end{itemize}

At this rung, Phase 4 only provides a minimal paper skeleton and no
mapping implementations. Reproducibility therefore reduces to
rebuilding the present PDF via the Phase 4 gate script.
