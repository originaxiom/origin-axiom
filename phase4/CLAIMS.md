# Phase 4 Claims (Draft, non-binding)

Status: **DRAFT – DO NOT CITE AS BINDING.**

This file sketches the *intended* shape of Phase 4 claims. These become
binding only when:

1. The Phase 4 work is complete and audited; and
2. The claim IDs and statements are explicitly marked as LOCKED in this
   file and in the Phase 4 claims table; and
3. Phase 0’s global contract is updated (if needed) to acknowledge any
   new binding filters.

## Intended claim IDs (provisional)

### C4.1 – Existence of a structurally reasonable mapping

> There exists at least one explicit mapping from the Phase 3 global
> amplitude \(A(\theta)\) (or a derived residue) into a toy FRW-like
> or vacuum-energy-like observable such that the resulting dynamics are
> numerically stable and free of obvious pathologies (e.g. runaway
> blow-ups for generic initial conditions).

Status: **DRAFT**  
Binding: **No**

### C4.2 – Corridor behaviour under the mapping

> For at least one mapping defined in Phase 4, the induced constraints
> on \(\theta\) give rise to a **non-empty, non-trivial** corridor:
> a subset of \([0, 2\pi)\) that is neither the full interval nor
> empty, and whose definition is reproducible by the Phase 4 gate.

Status: **DRAFT**  
Binding: **No**

### C4.3 – Informative failure mode (empty / pathological corridors)

> If all investigated mappings in Phase 4 yield empty or pathological
> \(\theta\)-corridors, Phase 4 will instead deliver an explicit
> *negative* claim: that this particular realisation of the Phase 3
> global-amplitude mechanism appears incompatible with even toy-level
> FRW / vacuum-energy behaviour under the tested mapping families.

Status: **DRAFT**  
Binding: **No**

This claim is intentionally asymmetrical: Phase 4 must report either a
live corridor (C4.2) or a structured negative result (C4.3). It is not
permitted to silently ignore an empty-corridor outcome.

These are *design targets* for Phase 4, not yet earned facts. They may
be refined, split, or retired as the work progresses.

Doc status: Draft Phase 4 claims register; current interpretation of Phase 4 claims is constrained by `phase4/PHASE4_ALIGNMENT_v1.md`, Stage 2 FRW and joint verdicts, and the FRW promotion gates; this file remains explicitly draft / non-binding until a Phase 4 lock rung is executed.
