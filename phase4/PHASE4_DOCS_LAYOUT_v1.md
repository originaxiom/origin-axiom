# Phase 4 documentation layout (Stage 2 snapshot)

Status (2026-01-11): This note classifies Phase 4 Markdown docs into canonical contracts, design and planning notes, and historical or audit material. It does not change any claims.

## 1. Canonical contracts

These files define Phase 4 as an FRW-facing toy corridor stub and control what it is allowed to claim:

- `phase4/SCOPE.md` — Phase 4 scope (FRW-facing diagnostic stub).
- `phase4/CLAIMS.md` — Phase 4 claims (draft, but used as the claims table of record).
- `phase4/NON_CLAIMS.md` — explicit non-claims and guardrails.
- `phase4/CLAIMS_TABLE.md` — Phase 4 claims table for navigation.
- `phase4/REPRODUCIBILITY.md` — reproducibility plan for Phase 4 FRW pipelines.
- `phase4/PHASE4_ALIGNMENT_v1.md` — alignment memo between Phase 4 contracts, FRW code, and global docs.
- `phase4/OVERVIEW.md` — FRW stub overview and narrative for Phase 4.
- `phase4/PROGRESS_LOG.md` — Phase 4 progress log.
- `phase4/docs/PHASE4_FRW_PROMOTION_DESIGN_v1.md` — design for how Stage 2 FRW artifacts might be promoted into Phase 4/5 text under gating.

These documents constitute the binding description of Phase 4’s FRW stub and its relationship to Stage 2 diagnostics.

## 2. Design and planning notes

These files describe Phase 4 design space and are non-binding:

- `phase4/design/PLANNING.md` — Phase 4 planning note.
- `phase4/design/HARD_NOVELTY_ROADMAP.md` — hard-novelty roadmap for FRW + mechanism.
- `phase4/design/FRW_SYNTHESIS.md` — FRW-facing synthesis / F1 mapping design note.
- `phase4/design/MAPPING_FAMILIES.md` — draft design for corridor families and mappings.
- `phase4/design/FRW_TOY_DESIGN.md` — FRW-like toy diagnostic design note.
- `phase4/design/PHASE3_INTERFACE.md` — design for the Phase 3–Phase 4 interface.
- `phase4/design/FRW_DATA_DESIGN.md` — design for the FRW data probes and data gate.

These documents help explain how Phase 4 is intended to evolve but do not alter the canonical contracts unless the changes are mirrored in SCOPE/CLAIMS/NON_CLAIMS/REPRODUCIBILITY and the alignment memo.

## 3. Historical or audit material

Historical or audit-like Phase 4 material includes:

- Any older planning or synthesis notes that have been superseded by the alignment memo and Stage 2 promotion design.
- Any local audit notes or summaries (if present) that describe how the Phase 4 FRW tables were checked.

Such files are preserved for provenance and internal understanding but are not treated as live claims or contracts unless explicitly referenced by SCOPE/CLAIMS/NON_CLAIMS or the alignment memo.
