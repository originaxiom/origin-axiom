  "description": "Toy, non-binding 'instability penalty' functional for the Phase 3 baseline A0 distribution, constructed from eps_info in phase3_measure_v1_stats.json. The functional up-weights probability mass near A0 = 0 by weights proportional to 1/eps. It is intended only as a diagnostic of the cancellation basin in the current toy ensemble, not as a corridor constraint or physical scale.",
