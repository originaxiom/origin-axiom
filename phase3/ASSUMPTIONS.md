# Phase 3 Assumptions

## A. Axiom vs model vs fit separation
- The Origin Axiom is treated as a principle (non-cancellation floor).
- θ is a **model implementation parameter** (not required by the axiom).
- θ is obtained by a **fit** (empirical constraint within an ansatz class), not derived.

## B. Fit assumptions
- CKM/PMNS target data values are taken from stated sources and recorded with version/date.
- The ansatz family (mapping θ -> mixing parameters) is explicitly defined and fixed during Phase 3.
- Fit quality and uncertainty are reported (χ², dof, diagnostics).

## C. Injection assumptions
- Phase 2 vacuum module is treated as fixed input (no redefinition).
- θ enters only through declared hooks (e.g. m_eff(θ), phase-twist term, etc.).

## D. Reproducibility assumptions
- Deterministic seeds where stochasticity is present.
- Every figure/table is backed by a run directory and a manifest.
