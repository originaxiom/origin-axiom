\title{Origin Axiom — Phase 3 (Placeholder): Principled Mechanism}
\author{Origin Axiom Collaboration}
\date{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This file is a placeholder for the future Phase 3 "principled mechanism"
paper. As of this revision, no mechanism has been implemented. The previous
flavor-sector exploratory add-on has been archived under
\texttt{experiments/phase3\_flavor\_v1/}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Status}
Phase 3 is reserved for a principled mechanism by which a non-zero lower bound
on a vacuum-like amplitude or energy arises as a property of a model, not as
an algorithmic enforcement rule. The design and implementation of this
mechanism is work in progress and not yet part of the canonical codebase.
