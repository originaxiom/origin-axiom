\begin{abstract}
Phase~3 of the origin--axiom programme gives the first concrete
mechanism--level realisation of the non--cancellation floor proposed
in Phase~0.  We construct a finite ensemble of complex modes
\(z_k(\theta) = \exp[i(\alpha_k + \sigma_k \theta)]\) with fixed
phases \(\alpha_k\), integer windings \(\sigma_k\) and a global
amplitude observable
\(A_0(\theta) = \left|\frac{1}{N}\sum_k z_k(\theta)\right|\).  A
strictly positive floor \(\varepsilon > 0\) is enforced by
\(A(\theta) = \max(A_0(\theta), \varepsilon)\), with \(\varepsilon\)
chosen as a low quantile of the baseline amplitude distribution.  For
the Level--A configuration used here the mechanism exhibits a genuine
binding regime, with the floor active on a non--trivial fraction of
the \(\theta\) grid, and induces a measurable global shift between the
baseline and floor--enforced amplitudes.  All parameters, diagnostics
and figures are generated by explicit scripts under
\texttt{phase3/src/} and \texttt{phase3/outputs/}.  We emphasise that
this construction is a deliberately simple toy vacuum: it has no
spatial structure, no microscopic dynamics and no claimed direct
connection to the observed cosmological vacuum energy.  Its role is to
demonstrate, in a fully reproducible setting, that a non--cancellation
floor can be implemented without trivialising or overwhelming the
underlying amplitude dynamics.
