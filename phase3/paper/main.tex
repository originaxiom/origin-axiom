\begin{abstract}
This Phase~3 paper implements and tests a concrete toy mechanism for
a non-cancellation floor on a global amplitude observable.  We work
with a finite ensemble of complex modes
\(
  z_k(\theta) = \exp\!\bigl[i(\alpha_k + \sigma_k \theta)\bigr]
\)
with fixed phase offsets $\alpha_k$ and winding numbers
$\sigma_k \in \{1,2,3,4\}$, and define the baseline amplitude
\(
  A_0(\theta) = \bigl|\frac{1}{N}\sum_k z_k(\theta)\bigr|.
\)
On top of this ensemble we impose a simple floor,
\(
  A(\theta) = \max\bigl(A_0(\theta),\varepsilon\bigr),
\)
and study when this modification is both numerically well-behaved and
dynamically non-trivial.

The main contributions at this rung are: (i) an explicit, fully
specified toy configuration and $\theta$-scan that realise a genuine
\emph{binding regime}, in which the floor $\varepsilon$ is active on a
strictly between-zero-and-one fraction of the sampled grid; (ii)
numerical demonstrations that this binding regime produces measurable
global effects on the amplitude distribution (e.g.\ shifts in the
mean and a non-zero $L^2$ distance between $A_0$ and $A$); and (iii) a
set of reproducible diagnostics, including a separate measurement of
how often the ensemble approaches very small amplitudes and a
lightweight ``instability penalty'' built from these tails.

We make no claim that this toy mechanism corresponds to a physical vacuum, that the chosen floor $\varepsilon$ has any fundamental meaning, or that any particular value of $\theta$ is distinguished by Nature.  No corridor narrowing or parameter reduction is attempted at this rung.  The goal is strictly limited: to show, in a transparent and reproducible way, that a non-cancellation floor can be enforced in a controlled toy ensemble without collapsing into the pathologies of an always-binding or never-binding modification, and to prepare the ground for more physically motivated mechanisms in future rungs.
