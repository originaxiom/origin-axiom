\section{Scope and Non-Claims}
Phase 3 is an exploratory add-on phase.
We do not claim a solution to the cosmological constant problem, nor a first-principles derivation of $\theta$.
We report a reproducible fit for $\theta$ within a declared ansatz class and a reproducible injection of $\theta$
into an already-established vacuum residue mechanism.
