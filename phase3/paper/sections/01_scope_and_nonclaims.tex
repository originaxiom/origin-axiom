\section{Scope and Non-Claims}
\label{sec:scope}

\subsection{Role of Phase 3 in the program}
Phase 3 is a \emph{ledger-compatible add-on}: it extracts a candidate value and uncertainty interval for
\texorpdfstring{$\theta$}{theta} by fitting a fixed, explicitly stated ansatz to frozen external
flavor-sector targets (CKM and PMNS CP-phase information). The Phase 3 deliverable is not the internal
fit machinery; it is the exported, schema-stable artifact
\texttt{phase\_03\_theta\_filter.json}, designed to be consumable by the Phase~0 corridor/ledger
aggregation without requiring Phase 3 internals.

Concretely:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Inputs}: external target snapshot encoded in \texttt{phase3/fit/targets.yaml}
        (treated as frozen for this Phase 3 run) and the fixed ansatz implementation.
  \item \textbf{Outputs}: (i) fit summary and diagnostics tables, (ii) figures, (iii) this PDF report,
        and (iv) the ledger artifact \texttt{phase\_03\_theta\_filter.json}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What Phase 3 does and does not establish}
Phase 3 establishes only the following narrow fact: under the Phase 3 baseline ansatz and frozen targets,
there exists a best-fit \texorpdfstring{$\theta$}{theta} and an uncertainty interval produced by an explicit,
reproducible scan.

\paragraph{Non-claims (explicit).}
Phase 3 does \emph{not} claim:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a derivation of a unique fundamental constant \texorpdfstring{$\theta_\star$}{theta-star};
  \item a proof that the Origin Axiom is correct, complete, or uniquely determined;
  \item a reduction of Standard Model free parameters, or a predictive theory of the CKM/PMNS structures;
  \item a measurement-level global fit (this is not a replacement for PDG/NuFIT analyses);
  \item robustness to arbitrary re-parameterizations or model classes beyond the declared ansatz family.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Success criteria (Phase 1/2 style contract)}
A Phase 3 run is considered successful iff:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the workflow gate reproduces all declared artifacts end-to-end;
  \item the bundle manifest lists exactly the declared inputs/outputs with hashes and sizes;
  \item the paper claims remain within the narrow scope above (no implied derivation or discovery).
\end{itemize}
