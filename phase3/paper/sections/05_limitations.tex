\section{Limitations}
Phase 3 is intentionally conservative and under-claimed. The following limitations are explicit:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Exploratory add-on:} Phase 3 does not claim to derive CKM/PMNS phases from first principles; it fits a single parameter $\theta$ under a declared ansatz.
  \item \textbf{Frozen targets:} Numerical outcomes depend on the chosen frozen snapshot for CKM $\delta$ (PDG) and PMNS $\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}$ (NuFIT, ordering assumption).
  \item \textbf{Discrete offset choice:} The baseline $b_{\mathrm{PMNS}}=\pi$ is selected by a discrete sweep, not by fitting an additional parameter.
        This is a methodological choice to avoid parameter proliferation, but it also means the model class is only partially explored.
  \item \textbf{Injection diagnostic scope:} The injection-stage curve is treated as a reproducible diagnostic artifact.
        Interpretation as a physical prediction requires the Phase 2 mechanism definitions and assumptions, and remains outside Phase 3 claims.
  \item \textbf{Circular statistics:} Phase observables are periodic, and $\chi^2$ summaries can hide multimodal or wrap-around structure.
        We therefore treat $\chi^2$ comparisons as model-selection aids rather than strong statistical evidence.
\end{itemize}
