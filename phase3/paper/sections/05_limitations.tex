\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{External-target dependence:} results are conditional on frozen PDG/NuFIT-style targets
        encoded in \texttt{phase3/fit/targets.yaml}. Updates to those targets may shift or erase the
        extracted interval.
  \item \textbf{Ansatz dependence:} the extraction is conditional on the declared mapping family. Phase 3
        does not claim this family is unique or theoretically preferred.
  \item \textbf{Not a global fit:} this is not a full oscillation-data reanalysis or a replacement for PDG
        or NuFIT methodologies; it is a single-parameter exploratory scan.
  \item \textbf{Interpretation bound:} the only supported downstream interpretation is ledger comparison
        (corridor overlap) with other phases; no discovery claim is implied.
\end{itemize}
