\section{Baseline experiments (skeleton)}
\label{sec:baseline-experiments}

At Rung~1 no numerical experiments are yet performed. This section
exists only to mark the structure of the eventual paper:

\begin{itemize}
  \item description of the baseline unconstrained dynamics;
  \item description of the dynamics under the non-cancellation rule;
  \item definition of the residual-energy observable; and
  \item extraction of an admissible $\theta$ corridor and a
        theta-filter artifact compatible with the Phase~0 ledger.
\end{itemize}

All numerical values, figures, and tables are deliberately omitted at
this stage to avoid giving the impression of claims that have not yet
been earned by code and data.
