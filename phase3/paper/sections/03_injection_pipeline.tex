\section{Injection Pipeline: $\theta \rightarrow$ Phase 2 residue diagnostic}
Given the best-fit $\theta$ from the Phase 3 fit pipeline, we feed $\theta$ into the Phase 2-style injection mechanism
as an exploratory diagnostic step. This add-on is strictly under-claimed: the purpose is to document a reproducible,
traceable correlation between the fitted flavor-phase parameter and the injection-style residue diagnostic.

\subsection{Provenance lock for the injection figure}
The injection stage consumes the fitted summary artifact (\texttt{theta\_fit\_summary.csv}) and emits the figure
\texttt{fig2\_delta\_rho\_vac\_vs\_theta.pdf}. Alongside the PDF we generate a strict provenance record
\texttt{fig2\_delta\_rho\_vac\_vs\_theta.meta.json} that binds the plot to:
(i) the exact git commit hash, (ii) SHA-256 hashes of the fit summary and \texttt{targets.yaml}, and
(iii) the locked baseline model choice (including the fixed $b_{\mathrm{PMNS}}$ value).
This ensures the injection plot cannot drift away from the declared Phase 3 baseline hypothesis or the frozen targets.
