\section{Injection Pipeline: \texorpdfstring{$\theta$}{theta} \texorpdfstring{$\rightarrow$}{->} Phase 2 diagnostic}
\label{sec:injection}

The injection stage is a \emph{downstream diagnostic} that consumes the fitted
\texttt{theta\_\allowbreak fit\_\allowbreak summary.csv} artifact and evaluates the Phase~2 injection
observable (vacuum-residue response) as a function of \texorpdfstring{$\theta$}{theta}.
This stage does \emph{not} participate in the Phase 3 fit objective and therefore cannot retroactively
improve the CKM/PMNS fit. Its role is purely cross-phase: it allows the Phase 3 best-fit interval to be
visualized against the Phase 2 diagnostic curve, producing Figure~2 and associated provenance metadata.

All injection outputs are packaged in the Phase 3 paper bundle and listed in the manifest. The workflow
records the exact inputs, hashes, and run environment so the diagnostic can be regenerated verbatim.
