\section{Mechanism design (skeleton)}
\label{sec:mechanism-design}

This section is a placeholder at Rung~1. It records the intended role
of the Phase~3 mechanism without yet committing to a specific model.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{State space:} a finite collection of degrees of freedom
        representing a toy vacuum configuration (to be specified).
  \item \textbf{Dynamics:} an update map or flow that, in the absence of
        a floor, would admit configurations with arbitrarily small net
        amplitude or residual.
  \item \textbf{Non-cancellation rule:} an explicit constraint that
        enforces $|A| \ge \epsfloor$ for a suitable global observable
        $A$, in the sense of the Phase~0 contract.
  \item \textbf{Observables:} a residual-energy proxy and a
        $\theta$-dependent diagnostic that can be exported as a
        theta-filter artifact.
\end{itemize}

Subsequent rungs will replace this section with a fully specified toy
model, including equations, update rules, and the definition of the
binding regime and binding certificate.
