\section{Discussion and limitations (skeleton)}
\label{sec:limitations}

This Phase~3 mechanism paper is at a very early rung. The present
version only defines the narrative structure and the contracts that
future rungs must satisfy.

In particular, we do not yet:
\begin{itemize}
  \item commit to a specific toy vacuum system or update rule;
  \item claim any correspondence with observed vacuum energy or
        cosmological data; or
  \item claim that the toy mechanism realises a fundamental physical
        principle rather than an exploratory numerical construction.
\end{itemize}

These limitations are intentional at this stage and will be narrowed in
later rungs as concrete models and experiments are introduced.
