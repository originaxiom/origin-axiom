\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Phase~3 in the Origin-Axiom program is the \emph{mechanism phase}: it
implements and probes a concrete toy vacuum system in which a
non-cancelling global amplitude constraint is enforced, in a way that is
compatible with the Phase~0 contract.

The goal at this rung is modest:
\begin{itemize}
  \item define a clear separation between the non-cancellation rule
        (the ``axiom'') and the dynamics of the toy vacuum system;
  \item specify the observables that the mechanism exposes to the
        corridor ledger (notably a residual-energy proxy and an
        admissible $\theta$ corridor); and
  \item provide a minimal reproducible implementation and PDF report,
        without yet claiming any contact with real cosmological data.
\end{itemize}

The detailed mechanism design and experiments will be introduced in
later rungs; this skeleton paper exists to follow the Phase~0
requirement that each phase have a well-defined narrative, claims
table, and gate-verified artifact.
