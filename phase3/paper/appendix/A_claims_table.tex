\section*{Appendix A: Phase 3 mechanism claims table (skeleton)}
\label{app:phase3_mech_claims}

At Rung~1 no positive scientific claims are made beyond those already
stated in the Phase~0 contract and the Phase~3 mechanism contract
(``MECHANISM\_CONTRACT.md''). This appendix will eventually contain a
structured table (C3.m.x) of Phase~3-specific claims, once a concrete
mechanism and experiment suite exist.
