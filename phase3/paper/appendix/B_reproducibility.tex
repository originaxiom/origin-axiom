\section*{Appendix B: Reproducibility and gate levels (skeleton)}
\label{app:phase3_mech_repro}

The Phase~3 mechanism implementation follows the multi-level gate
structure defined in the Phase~0 contract. At Rung~1 we define only the
filesystem layout and the top-level gate script:

\begin{itemize}
  \item source code under \texttt{phase3/src/phase3\_mech/},
  \item paper sources under \texttt{phase3/paper/},
  \item outputs under \texttt{phase3/outputs/},
  \item artifacts under \texttt{phase3/artifacts/}, and
  \item Snakemake workflow under \texttt{phase3/workflow/Snakefile}.
\end{itemize}

The gate script \texttt{scripts/phase3\_gate.sh} drives the workflow
from the repository root. At this rung, Level~A/B gates only verify that
the skeleton paper compiles and that the canonical PDF
\texttt{phase3/artifacts/origin-axiom-phase3.pdf} is regenerated from
the LaTeX sources.
