# Phase 3 Optional Note (NON-CLAIMED): Interpretation Pathways

This note is not a Phase 3 claim. It sketches two possible ways a non-cancellation floor
could be expressed in mainstream physics language:

1) Global constraint / sequestering-like variable (vacuum gravitation control).
2) θ-vacuum analogue: vacuum energy depends on a global angle.

These are interpretation pathways only; no derivation is asserted in Phase 3.
