# Phase 3 Claims

## C3.1 — Fit claim (within ansatz)
We can reproduce a best-fit θ and uncertainty interval from the stated CKM+PMNS targets within the Phase 3 ansatz class, with documented goodness-of-fit and diagnostics.

## C3.2 — Injection claim (conditional)
Given a θ value (fit-derived), injecting θ into the Phase 2 vacuum mechanism produces a reproducible Δρ_vac(θ) / residue metric curve under the declared injection hook.

## C3.3 — Falsifiability claim (procedural)
We provide explicit conditions under which the flavor↔vacuum linkage hypothesis would be weakened or falsified (e.g., if future data exclude the fitted θ region under the chosen ansatz).
