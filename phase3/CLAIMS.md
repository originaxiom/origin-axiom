# Phase 3 Claims

## C3.1 — Fit claim (within ansatz)
We can reproduce a best-fit θ and uncertainty interval from the stated CKM+PMNS targets within the Phase 3 ansatz class, with documented goodness-of-fit and diagnostics.

## C3.2 — Injection claim (conditional)
Given a θ value (fit-derived), injecting θ into the Phase 2 vacuum mechanism produces a reproducible Δρ_vac(θ) / residue metric curve under the declared injection hook.

## C3.3 — Falsifiability claim (procedural)
We provide explicit conditions under which the flavor↔vacuum linkage hypothesis would be weakened or falsified. For example:
- if future data exclude the fitted θ region under the chosen ansatz; or
- if the Phase 0 corridor ledger, when updated with the Phase 3 θ-filter, yields an empty
  intersection with the Phase 0–2 corridor, indicating that no θ survives all filters for
  that specific Phase 3 ansatz/target combination.
In both cases, the failure is attributed to the locked ansatz/target choice and test suite,
not treated as a proof that the Origin Axiom itself is false.
