\section{Axioms and definitions (governance vocabulary)}
\label{sec:axioms_definitions}

This section defines the minimal vocabulary used throughout the project. These definitions are \emph{governance objects}: they specify how the repository communicates results and how those results are audited. They are not physics postulates.

\subsection{Core objects}

\paragraph{Claim.}
A \emph{claim} is a bounded statement asserted by a phase. A claim must be written in a standardized form (Section~\ref{sec:phase_contracts}) and must be supported by evidence. Claims are the only unit of scientific assertion in this project.

\paragraph{Non-claim boundary.}
A \emph{non-claim boundary} is an explicit list of statements that a phase does \emph{not} assert. Non-claims are mandatory: they prevent scope creep and protect later phases from inheriting unintended conclusions.

\paragraph{Evidence.}
\emph{Evidence} is a set of canonical artifacts (figures, tables, data summaries, run bundles) that directly support a claim. Narrative text, motivation, or conceptual analogies are not evidence.

\paragraph{Canonical artifact.}
A \emph{canonical artifact} is an evidence object with a stable location in the repository and a reproducible provenance. Canonical artifacts are either versioned directly (e.g., PDF figures) or generated deterministically from versioned inputs under the reproducibility contract (Section~\ref{sec:repro_contract}).

\paragraph{Provenance.}
\emph{Provenance} is the information required to reproduce an artifact: the code version, configuration/parameters, environment snapshot, and an execution identifier (run ID). Provenance must be sufficient for an independent reader to regenerate the artifact.

\subsection{Phase governance}

\paragraph{Phase.}
A \emph{phase} is a governed unit of work with a declared scope, allowed claim types, and required artifacts. A phase is considered \emph{locked} only when it satisfies the Phase 0 compliance checklist (Section~\ref{sec:p0_checklist}).

\paragraph{Scope contract.}
A \emph{scope contract} states what a phase is allowed to claim and what it forbids itself from claiming. Scope is binding: statements outside scope are invalid by definition.

\paragraph{Claims ledger.}
A \emph{claims ledger} is the authoritative list of claims for a phase (or for the project), including IDs, statements, evidence pointers, and non-claim boundaries. The ledger is the primary map from text to artifacts.

\subsection{Corridor governance}

\paragraph{Filter.}
A \emph{filter} is a structured, machine-readable restriction applied to a space of possibilities (e.g., parameter ranges). Filters may be introduced by phases as part of their evidence-based narrowing process.

\paragraph{Corridor.}
A \emph{corridor} is the current authoritative allowed region for a global filter (notably the $\theta$ corridor). Corridors are represented as structured artifacts and must be updated only through an append-only history.

\paragraph{Corridor history.}
The \emph{corridor history} is an append-only log of corridor updates. Each update must record: (i) the new corridor definition, (ii) the phase that produced it, (iii) the evidence artifacts justifying it, and (iv) the code/config provenance (run IDs and version information).

\subsection{Failure and falsifiability}

\paragraph{Failure mode.}
A \emph{failure mode} is a known way a phase can fail: conceptual invalidity, numerical instability, irreproducibility, artifact drift, or evidence insufficiency. Failure modes must be stated explicitly and revisited when results change.

\paragraph{Falsifier.}
A \emph{falsifier} is an explicit condition under which a claim should be rejected. Falsifiers may be numerical (e.g., stability breaks under parameter sweeps), logical (a contradiction with the phase contract), or empirical (in later phases, disagreement with measured quantities).

\subsection{Project axiom (governance, not physics)}
\label{sec:governance_axiom}

The only ``axiom'' of Phase 0 is governance:
\begin{quote}
Work is only considered complete when it is stated as bounded claims, supported by canonical artifacts, and reproducible from versioned inputs with recorded provenance.
\end{quote}

All physics hypotheses, models, and interpretations are deferred to later phases under these contracts.
