\begin{abstract}
Phase 0 defines the governance layer of the Origin Axiom program. Its purpose is not to advance a physical theory, but to make later phases auditable: claims must be bounded, evidence must be canonical and file-addressable, provenance must be recorded, and falsifiers must be stated explicitly.

Phase 0 contributes four deliverables. First, it defines a project vocabulary for claims, evidence, canonical artifacts, provenance, and phase scope contracts. Second, it introduces corridor governance: global filters (notably $\theta$ corridors) are treated as schema-validated artifacts with an append-only history, preventing silent narrowing. Third, it specifies the required structure of every claim (ID, statement, evidence pointers, non-claim boundaries, falsifiers, and provenance). Fourth, it defines a reproducibility contract, including a minimal run-bundle standard and failure-handling rules that quarantine broken evidence rather than hiding it.

Phase 0 makes no physics claims. It does not assert a value of $\theta^\star$, does not infer cosmology, and does not treat motivation as evidence. Its role is to provide the constitution under which later phases can make defensible, peer-review-friendly claims.
