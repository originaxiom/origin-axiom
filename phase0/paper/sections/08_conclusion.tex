\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Phase 0 defines the governance layer of this repository: how claims are stated, how evidence is bound to canonical artifacts, how phases are scoped, how reproducibility is enforced, and how failure is handled.

The central rule is simple: work is only considered complete when it is expressed as bounded claims, supported by canonical artifacts with explicit file pointers, and reproducible from versioned inputs with recorded provenance. Corridor governance prevents silent parameter narrowing by requiring schema-validated filter artifacts and an append-only history.

Later phases may propose physical models and interpretations only under these contracts. If a phase cannot provide evidence, provenance, and falsifiers, then its statements are not claims and must be labeled as speculation or future work. This is the minimal condition for an auditable, peer-review-friendly research program.
