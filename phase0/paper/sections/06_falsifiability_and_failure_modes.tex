\section{Falsifiability and failure modes}
\label{sec:falsifiability}

Phase 0 requires that every phase state what would falsify its claims and how failures are handled. This is not optional: without falsifiers, a claim is not scientifically meaningful. This section defines the minimum falsifiability and failure-reporting standards.

\subsection{Falsifiers (required)}
A \emph{falsifier} is an explicit condition under which a claim should be rejected. Each claim in a phase claims ledger must include falsifiers appropriate to its claim type:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Existence claims:} falsified if the defined effect disappears under stated conditions or collapses to numerical noise across verified precision settings.
  \item \textbf{Robustness claims:} falsified if the effect fails under reasonable parameter sweeps, discretization changes, tolerance changes, or seed variations (when applicable).
  \item \textbf{Bounded viability claims:} falsified if the comparator test fails under the declared test conditions (e.g., the claimed bounded consistency does not hold).
  \item \textbf{Mechanism/prediction claims:} falsified by direct contradiction with the stated mechanism tests or with external empirical comparators.
\end{itemize}

Falsifiers must be concrete. ``Could be wrong'' is not a falsifier. Each falsifier must correspond to a test, a diagnostic, or a comparator that can be executed or checked.

\subsection{Failure modes (required)}
A \emph{failure mode} is a predictable way a phase can fail. Each phase must list its primary failure modes, and each run bundle should record any failure encountered. Common failure modes include:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Artifact drift:} figures in papers do not match current pipeline outputs.
  \item \textbf{Reproducibility drift:} the pipeline no longer regenerates canonical artifacts from versioned inputs.
  \item \textbf{Numerical instability:} results depend discontinuously on discretization, cutoff, tolerances, or precision settings.
  \item \textbf{Parameter overfitting:} results depend on untracked tuning or hidden parameter choices.
  \item \textbf{Scope violation:} phase text asserts claims outside the scope contract or contradicts declared non-claims.
  \item \textbf{Evidence insufficiency:} claims are asserted without direct canonical artifacts.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Failure handling rules}
When a failure occurs, the correct response is governed:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Record:} log the failure in the relevant progress log with a minimal error summary and the affected artifacts/claims.
  \item \textbf{Quarantine:} mark any dependent claims as ``broken evidence'' (or remove them from the locked set) until repaired.
  \item \textbf{Repair:} restore reproducibility (fix pipeline, restore missing inputs, update provenance, or revert code).
  \item \textbf{Re-validate:} regenerate canonical artifacts and verify the claim-to-evidence mapping.
  \item \textbf{Disclose changes:} if repaired outputs differ materially, record that difference explicitly and update claims/paper text as needed.
\end{enumerate}

This procedure ensures scientific honesty while maintaining an auditable record.

\subsection{Speculation policy (scope protection)}
This project allows speculation only under strict labeling:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Speculation must be explicitly labeled as \emph{non-claim} or \emph{future work}.
  \item Speculation must not be cited as evidence for any claim.
  \item Speculation must not weaken phase scope contracts (a phase may not ``smuggle'' a mechanism claim via discussion text).
\end{itemize}

A simple rule applies: if a statement is important enough to influence interpretation, it must be promoted to a bounded claim with evidence and falsifiers, or it must be demoted to clearly labeled speculation.

\subsection{Relationship to corridor governance}
Corridor narrowing is a scientific commitment. If a corridor update is based on a viability filter, then the filter itself must have falsifiers (e.g., demonstrate that the viability criterion is applied uniformly and reproducibly). If later work shows the narrowing rule fails its own falsifiers, the corridor must be widened via an explicit append-only history entry rather than silently rewritten.
