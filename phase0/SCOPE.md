# Phase 0 – Scope and Non-claims

Phase 0 defines the **governance and method layer** for the Origin Axiom program.

## In scope

- Claim taxonomy and phase contracts.
- Definition and schema of theta-filters and corridors.
- Reproducibility, provenance, and archive/deprecation policies.
- Formalization of Phase 0 claims P0-C01–P0-C07 and their evidence.

## Out of scope (non-claims)

Phase 0 **does not**:

- make any statements about the physical correctness of the residue mechanism,
- fix any specific value of \(\theta_\star\),
- interpret numerical results from Phase 1 or Phase 2.

All physics-adjacent claims are delegated to Phase 1+ under the Phase 0 contracts.
