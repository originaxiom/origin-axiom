# Frustrated Floor – Internal Concept Note (v1)

Status: **internal, non-binding, speculative overlay**  
Scope: conceptual background for the obstruction program and future θ-framework work. This note does **not** change any Phase 0–5 contracts or Stage 2 promotion gates and must not be cited as a claims document.

## 1. Purpose of this note

This note records, in one place, the internal motivation and status of the “frustrated floor” idea:

- as an ontological picture of reality as a never-completable cancellation process,
- as a possible origin story for a non-zero vacuum floor, and
- as a prospective interpretive layer on top of the existing obstruction stack (FRW kernel, external-style corridors, mechanism amplitudes).

The goal is to keep the conceptual ambition visible without confusing it with the **locked, audit-ready** structures in the repository.

---

## 2. Informal picture

Very informally, the frustrated floor picture says:

- Reality is not a static collection of things but an ongoing attempt of the total “something” to cancel to “nothing”.
- This attempt is governed by structured dynamics that always *try* to reduce some global “cancellation functional”.
- However, there is a hard floor: a strictly non-zero lower bound on that functional which cannot be crossed because of a deeper topological, informational, or structural obstruction.
- The energy budget, the felt flow of time, and the structure of spacetime are then viewed as bookkeeping of this impossible approach to perfect cancellation.

This is **ontological framing**, not a derivation. At this stage it is a way of thinking, not a theory of nature.

## 3. How this relates to the existing obstruction stack

The current repository already has:

- a static FRW kernel: θ-grid points that survive internal FRW masks (matter era, late-time acceleration, smooth H², etc.),
- vacuum and FRW-shape corridors: masks that select LCDM-like or toy-corridor-like FRW behaviour,
- external-style corridors: age bands, late-time expansion boxes, and simple structure proxies, treated explicitly as **diagnostic helpers**,
- mechanism amplitudes: Phase 3 baseline and binding amplitudes that measure how strongly a mechanism couples or “binds” at each grid point.

The frustrated floor picture suggests a possible reinterpretation of this stack:

- The **pre-data FRW kernel** is the subset of θ that already obeys internal background consistency.
- The **external-style corridors** model the fact that not all internally consistent backgrounds can host “our kind” of large-scale structure and late-time universe.
- The **mechanism amplitudes** are candidates for a “non-cancellation strength” associated with each θ-point: places where the mechanism refuses to go arbitrarily soft.

From this angle, a “frustrated floor” would correspond to the statement that there is:

- a structured subset of θ where both:
  - host-like external corridors are satisfied, and
  - mechanism amplitudes are bounded below by a non-trivial floor,
- and that outside this subset, either host viability fails or the mechanism would have to cancel “too much”.

The current obstruction stack **does not prove** such a floor exists. It only builds infrastructure to *look for* evidence of this pattern.

## 4. What we are **not** claiming

This note explicitly does **not** claim that:

- the frustrated floor picture is realised in nature;
- the current θ-grid, FRW masks, or mechanism amplitudes are faithful to any fundamental field;
- the non-cancellation floor can be derived from known principles (holography, topology, quantum information, etc.);
- the observed cosmological constant, or the vacuum-to-FRW mapping, are explained by this picture;
- the distinguished θ-values identified in previous work are physically meaningful.

All such statements remain **speculative** and must be treated as ideas to be tested, not as results.

---

## 5. What success would look like (high-level)

A future, more developed version of this idea would need to show, at minimum:

1. **Mathematical coherence.** A well-defined constrained dynamical system in which a global “cancellation functional” is driven toward a floor that cannot be breached, with clear assumptions and existence/uniqueness results where appropriate.
2. **Emergent spacetime story.** A non-circular derivation of spacetime structure (or at least FRW backgrounds) from the underlying dynamics rather than an ad hoc metric ansatz.
3. **Connection to the existing stack.** A principled mapping from the abstract dynamics to:
   - the θ-grid and vacuum parameters,
   - the FRW masks and corridors,
   - the mechanism amplitudes used in Phase 3.
4. **Empirical anchors.** At least one pre-specified, falsifiable contact point with cosmological observables (for example a functional form for w(z) or a structured pattern in FRW parameter space) that can, in principle, be ruled in or out by data.
5. **Compatibility with Phase 0 governance.** A way to promote specific, tightly scoped statements into phase-doc claims without diluting the audit standards that have been enforced so far.

At the time of this note, none of these items are completed. They are targets, not achievements.

## 6. Role in the obstruction program

Within the obstruction program the frustrated floor idea is currently:

- an **interpretive overlay** on top of:
  - the FRW kernel and FRW corridors,
  - the external-style age, expansion, and structure proxies,
  - the mechanism amplitudes and non-cancellation floor diagnostics;
- a way to organise questions such as:
  - “Does there exist a non-empty set of θ that simultaneously satisfies reasonable host-style corridors and a non-trivial mechanism floor?”
  - “If such a set exists, how large is it, and how sensitive is it to sharpening the corridors?”
  - “Do special θ-values identified in earlier work behave differently inside this obstruction stack than generic points?”

All obstruction-program code and docs remain diagnostic. They do not promote any frustrated floor narrative into claims.

---

## 7. Governance and promotion rules

To keep the project honest:

- Any promotion of frustrated-floor language into Phase 2–4 papers or claims tables must happen through explicit, named rungs with:
  - clearly declared scope,
  - explicit non-claims,
  - and reproducible links to code and tables.
- Until such rungs exist, the correct way to reference this idea is:
  - as “an internal conceptual motivation recorded in `docs/FRUSTRATED_FLOOR_INTERNAL_NOTE_v1.md`”,
  - and not as a part of the Origin-Axiom claim set.
- If future analysis shows that the frustrated floor picture is inconsistent with the obstruction stack or with observations, this note should be updated to record that fact explicitly rather than silently dropped.

This note is allowed to evolve, but changes should preserve its status as a **log of speculative motivation** rather than a moving target for claims.
