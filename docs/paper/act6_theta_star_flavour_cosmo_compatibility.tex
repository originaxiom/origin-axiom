\section{Act VI: $\theta_\star$ flavour posterior vs cosmology corridor}
\label{sec:act6_flavour_cosmo}

This act asks a single compatibility question: whether the $\theta_\star$ region preferred by flavour-mixing phenomenology (Act II) overlaps the $\theta_\star$ region admitted by the cosmology backbone corridor (Acts III--V).

\subsection{Inputs}
\textbf{Flavour posterior (Act II).}
We summarize $\theta_\star$ using the exported posterior summary produced in the companion repo (\texttt{origin-axiom-theta-star}), combining the canonical v2 (NO) runs under a fixed cut $\chi^2_{\rm total} \le 50$. The global quantiles are
\[
\theta_\star^{\rm flav} (q_{16}, q_{50}, q_{84}) = (2.0982,\ 3.5299,\ 5.5915)\ \mathrm{rad}.
\]

\textbf{Cosmology corridor (Acts III--V).}
We take the observable corridor bounds from the R23 corridor construction summary, yielding
\[
\theta_\star^{\rm cos} \in [2.4320,\ 3.8600]\ \mathrm{rad}.
\]

\subsection{Compatibility construction}
We treat the flavour posterior as the interval $[q_{16}, q_{84}]$ with median marker $q_{50}$, and the cosmology corridor as $[\theta_{\min}^{\rm cos}, \theta_{\max}^{\rm cos}]$. The overlap interval is the set intersection of these two intervals.

\subsection{Result}
The overlap is non-empty and equals the full cosmology corridor:
\[
\theta_\star^{\rm overlap} = [2.4320,\ 3.8600]\ \mathrm{rad}.
\]
Thus, under the current pipeline definitions, the cosmology-admitted $\theta_\star$ window is fully contained within the flavour-preferred band.

  \item \texttt{data/processed/theta\_star\_flavour\_cosmo\_compatibility.json}
  \item \texttt{figures/theta\_star\_flavour\_vs\_cosmo\_overlap.png}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
This act establishes only \emph{interval compatibility}. It does not refit flavour targets, does not re-run large cosmology sweeps, and does not claim observational parameter inference. The result is contingent on the fixed flavour cut $\chi^2_{\rm total}\le 50$ and the corridor definition used in R23.
