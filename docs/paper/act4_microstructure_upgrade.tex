\section{Act IV: Microstructure upgrades and robustness of the microcavity bridge}
\label{sec:act4-microstructure}

In this Act we move beyond the minimal one-dimensional scalar microcavity used
in Act~III and explore two complementary directions:
(i) robustness of the existing $\Delta E(\theta_\star)$ bridge under variations
of the toy microcavity parameters, and (ii) upgraded microstructure models that
are still computationally cheap but closer in spirit to realistic vacuum
microstructure.
