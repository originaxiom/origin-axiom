\section{Act V: Dynamical $\theta_\star$ and an effective vacuum bridge}
\label{sec:act5-dynamical-theta-star}

In this act we take the flavour-informed master phase $\theta_\star$ from
Act~II and probe how it behaves once we embed it into a simple microscopic
vacuum toy, a microcavity model, and then map the resulting vacuum shift to
an effective cosmological constant in a flat FRW universe.
The overarching question is whether the same $\theta_\star$ that already does work in the quark + lepton sector can act as a \emph{single dial} that

\begin{enumerate}
  \item selects a preferred region in a microstructure toy,
  \item induces a negative vacuum-energy shift $\Delta E(\theta_\star)$,
  \item and can be rescaled into an effective dark-energy fraction
  $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ that reproduces a late-time accelerated expansion.
\end{enumerate}

Throughout this act we keep three principles explicit:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The microcavity model is a deliberately minimal toy: a one-dimensional scalar chain with a $\theta_\star$-dependent mass modulation in a central region.
  \item The mapping from $\Delta E(\theta_\star)$ to $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ is a \emph{single-parameter scaling}, fixed by demanding $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_{\star,\rm fid}) \simeq 0.7$ at a fiducial $\theta_{\star,\rm fid}$ drawn from the Act~II flavour prior.
  \item We work in dimensionless FRW units with $H_0 = 1$, and only later comment on physical scales.
\end{itemize}

The result is not a claim of a precision prediction for the observed cosmological constant, but a proof-of-concept pipeline

\begin{equation}
  \theta_\star \;\longrightarrow\;
  \Delta E(\theta_\star) \;\longrightarrow\;
  \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star) \;\longrightarrow\;
  a(t)
\end{equation}

that can be refined or replaced by more realistic microphysics in future work.


\subsection{R1: Act II prior and microcavity model}

Act~II delivers a consolidated posterior for the master phase $\theta_\star$
by fitting PMNS and CKM mixings in a common ansatz.
For the purposes of this act we summarise that information by

\begin{itemize}
  \item a fiducial value $\theta_{\star,\rm fid} \simeq 3.63~\mathrm{rad}$,
  \item a working prior band $\theta_\star \in [2.18, 5.54]~\mathrm{rad}$,
\end{itemize}

which are exported from the flavour analysis via a configuration file
(\texttt{config/theta\_star\_config.json}) and read by the microcavity scripts as a small dataclass.\footnote{See Sec.~\ref{sec:theta_star_prior} for the full flavour-side posterior and its construction.}
This is the first appearance of $\theta_\star$ in this repo: whenever we say
``run the toy universe at $\theta_\star$'' or ``scan the $\theta_\star$ band'',
these are the values we use.

The microcavity toy is a one-dimensional scalar chain with open boundaries,
nearest-neighbour coupling $c$, and a baseline mass $m_0$.
We designate a central sub-interval as a ``cavity'', and modulate the mass there according to

\begin{equation}
  m(x;\theta_\star)
  \;=\;
  \begin{cases}
    m_0, & x \text{ outside cavity},\\[0.3em]
    m_0\,[1 + \alpha_{\rm mass}\cos(\theta_\star - \theta_0)], & x \text{ inside cavity},
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

so that the cavity is lighter or heavier than the surroundings depending on
$\theta_\star$.
The Hamiltonian is

\begin{equation}
  H(\theta_\star)
  \;=\;
  \mathrm{diag}\!\bigl( m(x;\theta_\star)^2 + 2c \bigr)
  \;-\;
  c\,(\text{nearest-neighbour off-diagonals}),
\end{equation}

and we define the vacuum-energy shift as

\begin{equation}
  \Delta E(\theta_\star)
  \;\equiv\;
  E_0^{\rm cavity}(\theta_\star) - E_0^{\rm uniform},
\end{equation}

where $E_0^{\rm uniform}$ is the ground-state energy of the same chain
with a spatially uniform $m_0$ (no cavity),
and $E_0^{\rm cavity}(\theta_\star)$ is the ground-state energy for the
$\theta_\star$-dependent mass profile above.

Numerically, with the parameters used here (chain length $N=256$, $m_0=0.1$,
$c=1.0$, cavity covering 20\% of the chain, $\alpha_{\rm mass}=0.5$), the
uniform energy is approximately constant,

\begin{equation}
  E_0^{\rm uniform}
  \;\approx\;
  1.01\times 10^{-2}
\end{equation}

over all $\theta_\star$, while the cavity energy produces a non-trivial
$\Delta E(\theta_\star)$ in the flavour band.
This is the first explicit microstructure toy where the same $\theta_\star$
that appears in flavour fits changes a vacuum energy in a controlled way.

We record a finite sample of $\theta_\star$ values in the Act~II band and
their associated energy shifts in the file
\texttt{data/processed/theta\_star\_prior\_1d\_microcavity\_samples.npz},
with entries

\begin{equation}
  \left\{
    \theta_{\star,i},\;
    E_0^{\rm cavity}(\theta_{\star,i}),\;
    \Delta E(\theta_{\star,i})
  \right\}_{i=1}^{N_{\rm sample}}.
\end{equation}

This dataset is only an intermediate sanity check; for the effective-vacuum
bridge we work with a denser scan, described in the next subsection.


\subsection{R2: Microcavity full-band scan $\Delta E(\theta_\star)$}
\label{subsec:microcavity_scan}

To understand how the microcavity behaves over a full $0$--$2\pi$ cycle,
we compute $\Delta E(\theta_\star)$ on a dense grid
$\theta_\star \in [0, 2\pi)$ with $N_\theta = 256$ points.
Operationally, the script

\begin{center}
  \texttt{src/scan\_1d\_theta\_star\_microcavity\_full\_band.py}
\end{center}

builds the Hamiltonian $H(\theta_\star)$ for each grid point,
diagonalises it to obtain $E_0^{\rm cavity}(\theta_\star)$, and subtracts
the uniform reference $E_0^{\rm uniform}$ to form $\Delta E(\theta_\star)$.
The results are stored in

\begin{center}
  \texttt{data/processed/theta\_star\_microcavity\_scan\_full\_2pi.npz},
\end{center}

with fields
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{theta\_grid} (length-256 array of $\theta_\star$ values),
  \item \texttt{E0\_uniform} (scalar),
  \item \texttt{E0\_cavity} (length-256 array of cavity ground-state energies),
  \item \texttt{delta\_E} (length-256 array of $\Delta E(\theta_\star)$),
  \item metadata for the microcavity parameters and the $\theta_\star$ prior.
\end{itemize}

The scan shows a smooth, almost sinusoidal profile for $\Delta E(\theta_\star)$.
For the parameters chosen here, the global minimum lies near

\begin{equation}
  \theta_{\star,\rm min}
  \;\approx\;
  \pi
  \;\approx\;
  3.14~\mathrm{rad},
  \qquad
  \Delta E_{\rm min}
  \;\approx\;
  -5.9\times 10^{-3},
\end{equation}

and the maximum near $\theta_\star \approx 0$ (or $2\pi$) with a small positive
$\Delta E(\theta_\star)$.
Importantly, the Act~II band

\begin{equation}
  \theta_\star \in [2.18, 5.54]~\mathrm{rad}
\end{equation}

fully contains the microcavity valley: in the entire band we have
$\Delta E(\theta_\star) < 0$, i.e.\ the cavity lowers the vacuum energy
relative to the uniform chain.

We summarise this scan by a small core file

\begin{center}
  \texttt{data/processed/theta\_star\_microcavity\_core\_summary.json},
\end{center}

which stores
\begin{itemize}
  \item a fiducial angle $\theta_{\rm fid,\,nominal} = 3.63~\mathrm{rad}$,
  \item the nearest grid point $\theta_{\rm fid,\,grid}$,
  \item the corresponding $\Delta E_{\rm fid} = \Delta E(\theta_{\rm fid,\,grid})$,
  \item the minimum value $\Delta E_{\rm min}$ and its location,
  \item the band endpoints in $\theta_\star$.
\end{itemize}
This core summary is the only microcavity input needed for the effective
vacuum scaling in later rungs.


\subsection{R3: Effective vacuum scaling and FRW bridge}
\label{subsec:frw-from-effective-vacuum}

The next step is to connect the dimensionless microcavity energy shift
$\Delta E(\theta_\star)$ to a dimensionless dark-energy fraction $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ in a flat FRW model.
We adopt a deliberately minimal mapping,
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)
  \;\equiv\;
  \mathrm{clip}\!\left(
    k_{\rm scale}\,\Delta E(\theta_\star),\;0,\;0.999
  \right),
  \label{eq:omega-lambda-scaling}
\end{equation}
where $k_{\rm scale}$ is a constant set by a single fiducial condition,
and the clip ensures that the resulting $\Omega_\Lambda$ stays between $0$
and a value slightly below $1$.

We choose the fiducial point to be the flavour-informed
$\theta_{\star,\rm fid} \simeq 3.63~\mathrm{rad}$.
From the microcavity core summary we obtain
\begin{equation}
  \Delta E_{\rm fid}
  \;\equiv\;
  \Delta E(\theta_{\star,\rm fid})
  \;\approx\;
  -5.33\times 10^{-3},
\end{equation}
and impose
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_{\star,\rm fid})
  \;\equiv\;
  \Omega_{\Lambda,\rm target}
  \;=\;
  0.7.
\end{equation}
This fixes the scaling
\begin{equation}
  k_{\rm scale}
  \;=\;
  \frac{\Omega_{\Lambda,\rm target}}{\Delta E_{\rm fid}}
  \;\approx\;
  -1.31\times 10^2,
\end{equation}
so that Eq.~\eqref{eq:omega-lambda-scaling} reproduces
$\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_{\star,\rm fid}) \simeq 0.7$ by construction.
We then define a matter fraction
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_m(\theta_\star)
  \;=\;
  1 - \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star),
\end{equation}
and clamp it to $[0, 1]$ wherever necessary.

Given this effective vacuum mapping, the script
\texttt{src/run\_frw\_from\_effective\_vacuum.py} integrates a flat FRW
history with two components:
\begin{equation}
  H^2(a;\theta_\star)
  \;=\;
  H_0^2\Bigl[
    \Omega_m(\theta_\star)\,a^{-3} + \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)
  \Bigr],
\end{equation}
starting from $a_{\rm init} = 10^{-3}$ in units with $H_0 = 1$.
For comparison it also integrates a matter-only case with
$\Omega_m = 1$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0$.

At the fiducial $\theta_{\star,\rm fid}$, the effective-vacuum cosmology
has
\begin{equation}
  (\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda)
  \;\approx\;
  (0.3, 0.7),
\end{equation}
and the integrated scale factor reaches $a(t_{\rm final}) \approx 3.3\times 10^1$
at a fixed dimensionless time $t_{\rm final}$,
while the matter-only case reaches only $a(t_{\rm final}) \approx 3.9$.
The age and deceleration parameter of the effective-vacuum model are

\begin{equation}
  t_0 H_0 \approx 0.96,
  \qquad
  q_0 \;=\; \frac{1}{2}\Omega_m - \Omega_\Lambda \;\approx\; -0.55,
\end{equation}

which is qualitatively consistent with an accelerating, $\Lambda$CDM-like
universe in the usual $(\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda)\approx(0.3,0.7)$ regime.
In a simple Hubble-diagram comparison, the model with
$\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_{\star,\rm fid})\approx 0.7$ produces larger
luminosity distances at fixed redshift than the matter-only case,
again matching the qualitative features of supernova data.

We emphasise that this is still a toy bridge:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The absolute scale of $\Delta E$ is arbitrary; we only fix it by
  \emph{demanding} that $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_{\star,\rm fid})$ matches
  an observationally motivated value.
  \item The dependence on $\theta_\star$ enters only through the microcavity
  toy and the Act~II prior; no real-world field content is included.
\end{itemize}
Nevertheless, this rung establishes a working chain
\begin{equation}
  \theta_\star
  \longrightarrow
  \Delta E(\theta_\star)
  \longrightarrow
  \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)
  \longrightarrow
  a(t),
\end{equation}
which we will stress-test in the next rungs.

\subsection{R4: Effective vacuum $\theta_\star$ band scan}
\label{subsec:theta-star-band-scan}

Once the scaling is fixed at the fiducial point, we can ask how the
effective vacuum behaves over the entire Act~II band.
Concretely, we define

\begin{equation}
  \theta_{\rm band}
  \;=\;
  [2.18, 5.54]~\mathrm{rad}
\end{equation}

and sample it at $N_\theta = 41$ equally spaced points.
For each sample we evaluate $\Delta E(\theta_\star)$ from the
microcavity scan and map it to $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ using
Eq.~\eqref{eq:omega-lambda-scaling} with the fixed $k_{\rm scale}$.
This is implemented in \texttt{src/run\_effective\_vacuum\_band\_scan.py},
which produces a compact table

\begin{center}
  \texttt{data/processed/effective\_vacuum\_band\_scan.npz}
\end{center}

containing $(\theta_\star,\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star))$ pairs and the
core metadata $(\theta_{\rm fid},\Delta E_{\rm fid},k_{\rm scale})$.

The band scan shows that within the admissible $\theta_\star$ range,
the effective vacuum fraction varies between

\begin{equation}
  \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)
  \;\in\;
  [0,\,0.775],
\end{equation}

with a finite interval of angles for which $\Omega_\Lambda$ lies close
to the fiducial value $0.7$.
In particular, there is a ``good'' window

\begin{equation}
  \theta_\star \in [2.516, 3.692]~\mathrm{rad}
\end{equation}
for which
\begin{equation}
  \bigl|\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star) - 0.7\bigr| \le 0.05
  \quad\Rightarrow\quad
  \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star) \in [0.65,\,0.75].
\end{equation}
Nine of the 41 grid points lie in this window; the remainder produce
values of $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ that are either too small or
too large relative to the fiducial.

The local slope of $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ in this window remains
modest.
Near the left and right edges of the window we find
\begin{equation}
  \frac{{\rm d}\Omega_\Lambda}{{\rm d}\theta_\star}
  \sim \mathcal{O}(0.2\text{--}0.4)\;{\rm rad}^{-1},
\end{equation}
while around the mid-window point
$\theta_{\rm mid} \simeq 3.10~\mathrm{rad}$ the profile is extremely
flat,
\begin{equation}
  \left.\frac{{\rm d}\Omega_\Lambda}{{\rm d}\theta_\star}\right|_{\rm mid}
  \approx 2.3\times 10^{-2}\;{\rm rad}^{-1}.
\end{equation}
A naive linear estimate based on the mid-window slope would allow
order-one-radian excursions in $\theta_\star$ before leaving the
$\pm 0.05$ band.
In practice, the true tolerance is limited by the edges of the window itself,
\begin{equation}
  \Delta\theta_\star^{\rm (band)}
  \simeq \frac{3.692 - 2.516}{2}
  \approx 0.59~{\rm rad},
\end{equation}
which still corresponds to order-unity fractional changes in
$\theta_\star$.

The overall profile of $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ across the band is
summarised in Fig.~\ref{fig:effective_vacuum_band_scan}, produced by
\texttt{src/plot\_effective\_vacuum\_band\_scan.py}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/effective_vacuum_band_scan}
  \caption{%
    Effective vacuum fraction $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ as a function
    of $\theta_\star$ in the Act~II band
    $\theta_\star \in [2.18, 5.54]~\mathrm{rad}$.
    The scaling $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star) = k_{\rm scale}\,\Delta E(\theta_\star)$
    is fixed so that $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_{\star,\rm fid}) = 0.7$ at
    $\theta_{\star,\rm fid} = 3.63~\mathrm{rad}$.

    $\theta_\star \in [2.516, 3.692]~\mathrm{rad}$ where

  }
  \label{fig:effective_vacuum_band_scan}
\end{figure}


\subsection{R5: Dynamical tolerance of the $\theta_\star$ bridge}
\label{subsec:theta_star_dynamical_tolerance}

With the effective vacuum map in hand (R2--R3), we can now ask how
sensitive the late-time acceleration is to small deformations of the
microcavity phase $\theta_\star$. Concretely, we define
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)
  \equiv
  k_{\rm scale}\,\Delta E(\theta_\star)
  \,,
\end{equation}
where $k_{\rm scale}$ is fixed by the fiducial calibration
$\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_{\rm fid}) = 0.7$ with
$\theta_{\rm fid} = 3.63~{\rm rad}$ and
$\Delta E(\theta_\star)$ is taken from the 1D microcavity scan
of Sec.~\ref{subsec:microcavity_scan}.

We then scan $\theta_\star$ over the same ``cosmologically allowed band''
\begin{equation}
  \theta_{\rm band} \in [2.18,\,5.54]~{\rm rad}
\end{equation}
and evaluate $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ at 41 equally-spaced
samples. The resulting profile is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:effective_vacuum_band_scan}. A broad plateau is visible:
for
\begin{equation}
  \theta_\star \in [2.516,\,3.692]~{\rm rad}
\end{equation}
we find
\begin{equation}
  \bigl|\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star) - 0.7\bigr| \le 0.05
  \quad\Rightarrow\quad
  \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star) \in [0.65,\,0.75] \,,
\end{equation}
i.e.\ nine grid points in our scan lie within a conservative
$\pm 0.05$ tolerance band around the observational target
$\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 0.7$.

Within this window the local slope remains modest. Near the left and
right edges we find
\begin{equation}
  \frac{{\rm d}\Omega_\Lambda}{{\rm d}\theta_\star}
  \sim \mathcal{O}(0.2\text{--}0.4)\;{\rm rad}^{-1},
\end{equation}
while around the mid-window point
$\theta_{\rm mid} \simeq 3.10~{\rm rad}$ the profile is extremely
flat,
\begin{equation}
  \left.\frac{{\rm d}\Omega_\Lambda}{{\rm d}\theta_\star}\right|_{\rm mid}
  \approx 2.3\times 10^{-2}\;{\rm rad}^{-1}.
\end{equation}
A naive linear estimate based on this plateau slope would allow
$\mathcal{O}(1)$--rad excursions in $\theta_\star$ before leaving the
$\pm 0.05$ band. In practice, the true tolerance is limited by the
edges of the window itself,
\begin{equation}
  \Delta\theta_\star^{\rm (band)}
  \simeq \frac{3.692 - 2.516}{2}
  \approx 0.59~{\rm rad},
\end{equation}
which still corresponds to order-unity fractional changes in
$\theta_\star$.

We summarise R5 as follows:
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{R5 (Dynamical robustness).} Once the microcavity parameters
  are fixed by the fiducial calibration (R2--R3), there exists a
  broad plateau in $\theta_\star$ of width $\sim 1.2~{\rm rad}$ on
  which $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ remains within
  $\pm 0.05$ of $0.7$. Small to moderate drifts in the microscopic
  phase $\theta_\star$ therefore do not catastrophically destabilise
  the late-time acceleration; the $\theta_\star$-bridge from
  microphysics to FRW is dynamically tolerant.
\end{quote}
In other words, once the non-cancelling microcavity is tuned onto the
observed $\Omega_\Lambda$ slice, the ensuing cosmic acceleration is
robust under $\mathcal{O}(0.1\text{--}0.6)$--rad changes in the
underlying phase.


\subsection{R5: Effective vacuum patch ensemble}

The band scan in Fig.~\ref{fig:effective_vacuum_band_scan} shows that there is
an extended interval in $\theta_\star$ within the flavour-side prior band
$\theta_\star \in [2.18, 5.54]~\mathrm{rad}$ where the microcavity-backed
effective vacuum delivers $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ close to the observed
value $\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 0.7$. To make this more concrete, we now treat this
interval as a pool of candidate ``vacuum patches'' with slightly different
$\theta_\star$, and ask what fraction of patches would look like our Universe,
in the narrow sense of matching the late-time dark energy fraction.

Operationally, we draw $N_\mathrm{patch}$ values of $\theta_\star$ uniformly
within the band $[2.18, 5.54]~\mathrm{rad}$, evaluate the corresponding
$\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ using the same effective vacuum scaling as in
Sec.~\ref{subsec:frw-from-effective-vacuum}, and classify a patch as
``good'' whenever
\begin{equation}
  \bigl|\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star) - 0.7\bigr| \le 0.05.
\end{equation}
Figure~\ref{fig:effective_vacuum_patch_ensemble} shows a representative
realisation with $N_\mathrm{patch} = 1000$. The horizontal dashed line marks
the target value $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$, and the dotted lines indicate the
$\pm 0.05$ tolerance band. Patches falling inside the band are highlighted.

In this toy ensemble, roughly $f_\mathrm{good} \simeq 0.21$ of all patches
land in the observational window. Equivalently, if $\theta_\star$ were
distributed roughly uniformly over the prior band defined by the flavour
constraints, then a Universe with $\Omega_\Lambda$ in the observed range would
not be an exponentially rare accident: it would be a ${\cal O}(10^{-1})$
probability outcome inside this coarse prior. At the present level, this is
only an internal consistency check for the $\theta_\star$-driven picture; in
later work, the toy ensemble can be replaced by a more realistic measure over
$\theta_\star$ determined by dynamical evolution in the flavour sector.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/effective_vacuum_patch_ensemble}
  \caption{%

    effective vacuum scaling. The dashed line marks
    $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$; dotted lines indicate the $\pm 0.05$ tolerance
    adopted here. Highlighted points fall inside the observational window.
    In the illustrated realisation with $N_\mathrm{patch} = 1000$, roughly
    $21\%$ of patches lie in this window.
  }
  \label{fig:effective_vacuum_patch_ensemble}
\end{figure}


\subsection{R8: Localised two--field microstructure in a $\theta_\star$--selected vacuum}
\label{subsec:two_field_bump_microstructure}

The constructions in R2--R7 treat the effective vacuum primarily as a
homogeneous component in a flat FRW background.  To check that the
non--cancelling rule behaves sensibly also in the presence of localised
structure, we consider a simple two--field microstructure toy: a
one--dimensional chain hosting a localised ``bump'' in two coupled scalar
fields $(\phi,\chi)$ and evolve it with and without the non--cancelling
constraint.

Operationally, the script
\texttt{src/run\_two\_field\_bump\_1d.py} prepares a localised profile in
$\phi$ and a small perturbation in $\chi$, then evolves the system for a
finite time with fixed microscopic parameters (masses, coupling $g$, box
size and timestep).  Two runs are performed in parallel:
a free evolution without the Origin--Axiom constraint, and a constrained
evolution in which a simple non--cancelling rule is applied to a global
amplitude diagnostic.  The script records a set of diagnostic snapshots
to \texttt{data/processed/two\_field\_bump\_1d.npz}, including
\texttt{loc\_free} and \texttt{loc\_constrained}, which track the
localised bump amplitude as a function of time for the free and
constrained runs respectively.

Figure~\ref{fig:two-field-bump-loc-amp} shows a representative evolution
of the localised amplitude for both cases.
In the free run the bump gradually disperses and its amplitude decays
over the integration time.
In the constrained run the non--cancelling rule keeps the amplitude in
the same ballpark: the initial amplitudes coincide, the final amplitudes
differ only at the few--per--cent level, and simple diagnostics such as
the time spent above half the initial amplitude or the mean absolute
amplitude,
\begin{equation}
  \langle |\mathrm{loc}_{\rm free}|\rangle
  \simeq 0.60,
  \qquad
  \langle |\mathrm{loc}_{\rm constrained}|\rangle
  \simeq 0.58,
\end{equation}
show that the constrained evolution remains finite and behaves
quantitatively similarly to the free one.  The key point here is not to
prolong the bump lifetime, but to verify that the non--cancelling rule
does not introduce runaway behaviour or pathological amplification when
applied on top of a localised microstructure.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/two_field_bump_1d_loc_amp}
  \caption{
    Localised two--field bump amplitude in the 1D microstructure toy
    (R8).  We show the time evolution of a local diagnostic for the bump
    amplitude in the free run (no constraint) and in the constrained run
    with the Origin--Axiom non--cancelling rule active.
    In both cases the bump gradually disperses and its amplitude decays,
    but the constrained trajectory stays in the same finite range as the
    free one, with no sign of runaway growth.
    This serves as a first check that the non--cancelling rule can be
    applied consistently on top of a localised microstructure in a
    $\theta_\star$--selected effective vacuum.
  }
  \label{fig:two-field-bump-loc-amp}
\end{figure}

In the broader context of the Act~II/III bridge, this rung shows that
the same non--cancelling machinery used to define an effective vacuum
component can be applied to a simple localised excitation without destroying it or forcing it to trivialise.
The two--field bump remains a toy model, but it demonstrates that local excitations can live consistently on top of a $\theta_\star$--selected vacuum in the Origin--Axiom framework.


\subsection{Act V summary: from microcavity to an effective cosmological constant}
\label{sec:act5-summary}

In this act we closed the loop between a microscopic, discretised model
of vacuum energy and an effective cosmological constant at FRW scales.
Starting from the one-dimensional microcavity scan
$\Delta E(\theta_\star)$ over a full $0$--$2\pi$ band, we identified a
fiducial angle $\theta_{\star,\text{fid}} \simeq 3.63~\mathrm{rad}$ at
which the vacuum energy difference $\Delta E_{\rm fid}$ is negative and
of order $10^{-3}$ in the toy units of the lattice.
By demanding that this point reproduces an observationally motivated value of
the dark energy density, $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_{\star,\text{fid}}) = 0.7$, we
fixed a single proportionality constant $k_{\rm scale}$ that maps the
dimensionless microcavity energy shifts into an effective
$\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$.

With this prescription in place, we constructed an effective vacuum
model in which each choice of $\theta_\star$ inside a ``good'' band
$[2.18, 5.54]~\mathrm{rad}$ is associated to a different cosmological
constant.  Solving the Friedmann equations for a flat, matter-plus-vacuum
universe shows that the fiducial point $(\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda) =
(0.3, 0.7)$ reproduces the expected accelerated expansion relative to a
purely matter-dominated history, and yields distance--redshift relations
consistent with a standard $\Lambda$CDM-like background at the level of
this toy model.

The band scan reveals that, within the admissible $\theta_\star$ range,
$\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ varies between $0$ and $\simeq 0.78$,
with a finite interval of angles for which $\Omega_\Lambda$ lies close
to $0.7$.  By sampling $N_{\rm patch} = 1000$ random $\theta_\star$
values uniformly inside the band, we built an effective ``patch
ensemble'' and found that the resulting distribution of
$\Omega_\Lambda$ has mean $\langle \Omega_\Lambda \rangle \simeq 0.45$,
standard deviation $\sigma_{\Omega_\Lambda} \simeq 0.31$, and median
$\tilde{\Omega}_\Lambda \simeq 0.57$.  Approximately $21.5\%$ of the
patches fall into the observationally inspired window
$\Omega_\Lambda = 0.70 \pm 0.05$, and the central $68\%$ interval of
the ensemble extends up to $\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 0.76$.  In other
words, once the microcavity band is accepted as the relevant dynamical
domain, a patch with $\Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.7$ is statistically
typical rather than exponentially fine-tuned.

The construction here is deliberately minimalistic and remains a toy
model in several respects: the microcavity is one-dimensional, the
mapping from $\Delta E$ to $\Omega_\Lambda$ is linear and fixed by a
single fiducial point, and we have not yet coupled the effective vacuum
to realistic matter content beyond a dust-like component.  Nevertheless,
Act~V shows that the $\theta_\star$ degree of freedom can serve as a
dynamical label for vacuum energy in an ensemble of patches, and that
moderately typical values of $\theta_\star$ can reproduce a
$\Lambda$-like component of the right order of magnitude without
invoking a $10^{-120}$-level tuning by hand.  This is the bridge we
need between the underlying axiom and a macroscopic, FRW-level
description of accelerated expansion in the toy universe.


\paragraph{Patch ensemble statistics.}
To make the microcavity-backed effective vacuum more concrete, we draw an
ensemble of $N_{\rm patches} = 1000$ independent patches with
$\theta_\star$ sampled uniformly from the allowed band
$[2.18, 5.54]\,\mathrm{rad}$ and map each draw to an effective
vacuum fraction $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ using the calibrated
microcavity scaling.
In this ensemble we find
$\Omega_\Lambda \in [0.000, 0.775]$, with mean
$\langle \Omega_\Lambda \rangle \simeq 0.445$,
standard deviation $\sigma_{\Omega_\Lambda} \simeq 0.307$,
and median $\mathrm{med}(\Omega_\Lambda) \simeq 0.573$.
Focusing on the observationally motivated target window
$\Omega_\Lambda = 0.70 \pm 0.05$, we obtain
$215/1000 \approx 21.5\%$ of patches in the wide window,
$80/1000 \approx 8.0\%$ in the tighter
$\Omega_\Lambda = 0.70 \pm 0.02$ band,
and $39/1000 \approx 3.9\%$ in the most restrictive
$\Omega_\Lambda = 0.70 \pm 0.01$ window.
Thus, within this toy ensemble the ``$\Lambda$-like'' patches are not
exponentially rare in $\theta_\star$-space; rather, they occupy a
non-negligible fraction of the available band, reinforcing the idea
that a microcavity-induced effective vacuum can naturally populate
$\Omega_\Lambda \sim 0.7$ without fine-tuning.


\subsection{R6: Random-walk residence of $\theta_\star$ in the $\Omega_\Lambda$ band}
\label{sec:theta_star_random_walk_residence}

In this rung we treat $\theta_\star$ as a toy dynamical variable that executes
a one-dimensional random walk within the microcavity-supported band
$[\theta_{\min}, \theta_{\max}] = [2.18, 5.54]~\mathrm{rad}$.
The microscopic input is exactly the same as in the previous rungs:
we use the microcavity scan
$\Delta E(\theta_\star)$ from the file
\texttt{data/processed/theta\_star\_microcavity\_scan\_full\_2pi.npz}
and the calibrated scaling
$k_{\mathrm{scale}}$ from
\texttt{data/processed/theta\_star\_microcavity\_core\_summary.json},
so that
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)
  = \mathrm{clip}\!\left(
      k_{\mathrm{scale}}\,\Delta E(\theta_\star),
      0,\;0.999
    \right),
\end{equation}
with $k_{\mathrm{scale}} \simeq -131.4$ chosen such that
$\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_{\star,\mathrm{fid}}) \simeq 0.7$
at $\theta_{\star,\mathrm{fid}} = 3.63~\mathrm{rad}$.

We then evolve $N_{\mathrm{traj}} = 200$ independent trajectories of
$\theta_\star(t)$ as a simple Gaussian random walk with reflecting
boundaries at $\theta_{\min}$ and $\theta_{\max}$ and a typical step size
$\Delta\theta \simeq 0.02~\mathrm{rad}$ per timestep.
For each trajectory we record the induced $\Omega_\Lambda(t)$ and measure
the fraction of trajectory-time spent in three observational windows,
\begin{equation}
  \bigl|\Omega_\Lambda - 0.7\bigr| \leq \{0.05,\,0.02,\,0.01\}.
\end{equation}
The resulting residence fractions are approximately
$20.5\%$, $7.4\%$, and $3.7\%$ respectively, i.e.\ the random-walk motion
in $\theta_\star$ spends a non-negligible fraction of its time in a band
that is observationally indistinguishable from the fiducial
$\Lambda$CDM value.

Figure~\ref{fig:theta_star_random_walk_residence} shows the resulting
distribution of $\Omega_\Lambda$ values sampled along all trajectories,
together with the broad observational window
$\bigl|\Omega_\Lambda - 0.7\bigr| \leq 0.05$.
This figure is not an attempt at a physical equation of motion for
$\theta_\star$, but rather a toy demonstration that once the microcavity
scaling is fixed, a simple stochastic dynamics in $\theta_\star$ naturally
generates residence-time statistics in the observed $\Omega_\Lambda$ band
at the $\sim 10\%$ level.

    within this observational window.

\end{figure}


\paragraph*{R7: Prior over \texorpdfstring{$\theta_\star$}{theta*} vs.~effective vacuum}

As a final prior check, we propagate the original one-dimensional twisted-vacuum prior
over $\theta_\star$ (Sec.~\ref{sec:theta-star-prior-1d}) through the calibrated microcavity
response $\Delta E(\theta_\star)$ and the scaling factor $k_{\rm scale}$ defined above.
Concretely, for each prior sample $\theta_\star^{(i)}$ we evaluate
$\Omega_\Lambda^{(i)} = \mathrm{clip}\bigl(k_{\rm scale}\,\Delta E(\theta_\star^{(i)}),\,0,\,0.999\bigr)$,
which induces a corresponding prior over $\Omega_\Lambda$ backed by the same microcavity
data that enters our effective-vacuum construction.

Even with the small illustrative set of prior samples used here, the induced
$\Omega_\Lambda$ values span the full range from $\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 0$ up to
$\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 0.76$, with a mean around $\langle \Omega_\Lambda\rangle \simeq 0.40$
and a broad dispersion $\sigma(\Omega_\Lambda)\simeq 0.31$.
In other words, the prior over $\theta_\star$ is intentionally wide and does \emph{not}
build in any preference for the observationally favored value $\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 0.7$.
Any concentration of probability weight near $\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 0.7$ in the band,
patch, or random-walk analyses of Sec.~\ref{sec:theta-star-band-and-residence}
is therefore driven by the microcavity-backed effective-vacuum response,
not by a hand-tuned prior over $\theta_\star$ itself.


\subsection{Induced $\theta_\star$ prior in $\Omega_\Lambda$}
\label{sec:theta-star-prior-vs-effective}

In earlier steps we constructed a one-dimensional prior over $\theta_\star$,
based on a small set of representative lattice vacua in the defected 1D chain.
Here we ask what that prior implies for the effective dark-energy density,
once the microcavity calibration is taken seriously.

We start from the discrete prior samples
$\{\theta_{\star,i}\}$ stored in
\texttt{data/processed/theta\_star\_prior\_1d\_vacuum\_samples.npz},
and map each point through the microcavity-backed effective vacuum model
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)
  \;=\;
  \mathrm{clip}\!\left(
    k_{\rm scale}\,\Delta E(\theta_\star),\,0,\,0.999
  \right),
\end{equation}
where $k_{\rm scale}$ is fixed by the requirement
$\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star^{\rm fid}) = 0.7$ at
$\theta_\star^{\rm fid} = 3.63~\mathrm{rad}$.
The resulting histogram of $\Omega_\Lambda$ values defines an
``induced'' prior for the cosmological constant.

In this toy setup the induced $\Omega_\Lambda$ prior is broad:
it places substantial weight at values below the observed
$\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 0.7$, but comfortably reaches and slightly
exceeds the target range.  In other words, a simple prior over
$\theta_\star$ in the microcavity band does not narrowly fine-tune
$\Omega_\Lambda$, yet still assigns non-negligible probability
to a $\Lambda$CDM-like universe.

    $\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 0.7$.

\end{figure}


\subsection{R13: Observable $\theta_\star$ corridor from FRW constraints}
\label{sec:theta-star-observable-corridor}

The previous rungs established a microcavity--backed effective vacuum model $\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ over the Act~II prior band $\theta_\star \in [2.18,\,5.54]~\mathrm{rad}$, together with a simple FRW mapping that turns each choice of $\theta_\star$ into a flat matter+vacuum cosmology. In R13 we ask a minimal question: within this band, which values of $\theta_\star$ lead to cosmologies that look broadly compatible with late--time observations in terms of vacuum fraction, age, and acceleration?

Concretely, we take the FRW scan stored in \texttt{data/processed/effective\_vacuum\_theta\_frw\_scan.npz}, which tabulates, for each of 41 $\theta_\star$ samples across the band, the corresponding $(\Omega_\Lambda,\Omega_m)$, cosmic age $t_0$ in gigayears, deceleration parameter $q_0$, and a few representative luminosity distances $d_L(z)/(c/H_0)$ at redshifts $z=\{0.3,0.5,1.0\}$. We then define a simple ``observable corridor'' by imposing three cuts:
\begin{equation}
  0.60 \le \Omega_\Lambda \le 0.80,\qquad
  12.0~\mathrm{Gyr} \le t_0 \le 15.0~\mathrm{Gyr},\qquad
  q_0 < 0,
\end{equation}
i.e.\ we require a vacuum fraction in a broad $\Lambda$CDM--like range, a cosmic age in the right ballpark for $H_0 \simeq 70~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, and a currently accelerating universe.

Applying these cuts to the scan selects 18 out of 41 samples, corresponding to roughly $44\%$ of the original $\theta_\star$ band. The accepted points span
\begin{equation}
  \theta_\star \in [2.432,\,3.860]~\mathrm{rad},\qquad
  \Omega_\Lambda \in [0.609,\,0.775],\qquad
  t_0 \in [12.49,\,14.57]~\mathrm{Gyr},\qquad
  q_0 \in [-0.662,\,-0.413].
\end{equation}
In other words, the microcavity--backed effective vacuum admits a continuous $\theta_\star$ sub--band within which the induced FRW cosmology has (i) an accelerating expansion, (ii) a vacuum fraction of the right order of magnitude, and (iii) an age compatible with a $H_0 \sim 70~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ universe.

The flavour--informed fiducial phase $\theta_{\star,\mathrm{fid}} \simeq 3.63~\mathrm{rad}$ lies well inside this corridor. Combined with the simpler $\Omega_\Lambda$--only band from the effective--vacuum scan, this shows that the Act~II $\theta_\star$ prior is not only compatible with the microcavity energetics, but also with very basic FRW observables. In the present toy framework, a $\theta_\star$ value that fits quark--lepton mixing angles automatically lives in a region of the microcavity band where the induced vacuum fraction and background expansion history resemble a standard $\Lambda$CDM--like universe.



\subsection{R9--R16: Observable corridor in \texorpdfstring{$\theta_\star$}{theta*}}
\label{subsec:theta_star_observable_corridor}

The Act~II flavour analysis delivers a broad but nontrivial prior band for the
master phase,
\begin{equation}
  \theta_\star \in [\theta_{\star,\mathrm{lo}},\theta_{\star,\mathrm{hi}}]
  \simeq [2.18,5.54]~\mathrm{rad},
\end{equation}
with a fiducial value $\theta_{\star,\mathrm{fid}}\simeq 3.63~\mathrm{rad}$ exported to a small
configuration file.  In Act~III we promote the microcavity vacuum shift
$\Delta E(\theta_\star)$ into an effective FRW vacuum component by fixing a
single overall scaling $S$ such that the fiducial slice matches an illustrative
dark--energy fraction $\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 0.7$.  This fixes a map
$\theta_\star \mapsto \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$ over the Act~II band and
allows us to compute a family of flat FRW models with
$(\Omega_m(\theta_\star),\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star))$.

The first step is a coarse ``band scan'' (R12) in which we evaluate, on a
uniform grid in $\theta_\star$, the present--day age $t_0(\theta_\star)$, the
deceleration parameter $q_0(\theta_\star)$, and a few toy luminosity
distances $d_L(z;\theta_\star)$, always assuming a fixed Hubble parameter
$H_0=70~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$.
Across the Act~II band the effective vacuum fraction varies in the range
$\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)\in[0,0.78]$, the age spans
$t_0(\theta_\star)\simeq 9.3$--$14.6~\mathrm{Gyr}$, and the present--day
expansion interpolates smoothly between a decelerating, matter--dominated
regime and an accelerating, vacuum--dominated one.
Already at this level the fiducial slice behaves qualitatively like a standard
$(\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda)\simeq(0.3,0.7)$ cosmology when viewed through
$H_0t_0$, $q_0$ and $d_L(z)$.

In R13 we impose loose, observation--inspired cuts on this band to define an
``observable corridor'' in $\theta_\star$.
For definiteness we require
\begin{equation}
  0.60 \le \Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star) \le 0.80,
  \qquad
  12~\mathrm{Gyr} \le t_0(\theta_\star) \le 15~\mathrm{Gyr},
  \qquad
  q_0(\theta_\star) < 0,
\end{equation}
which are deliberately conservative: they are not precision fits to real
datasets, but simple filters capturing a late--time, accelerating universe
of roughly the observed age.
Applied to the FRW band scan, these cuts select $18$ out of $41$ sampled
values of $\theta_\star$, corresponding to a corridor
\begin{equation}
  \theta_{\star,\mathrm{corridor}}
  \simeq [2.43,3.86]~\mathrm{rad},
\end{equation}
with associated ranges
$\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)\in[0.61,0.78]$,
$t_0(\theta_\star)\simeq 12.5$--$14.6~\mathrm{Gyr}$, and
$q_0(\theta_\star)\simeq -0.66$--$-0.41$.
Figure~\ref{fig:theta-star-observable-corridor} shows the resulting
$\Omega_\Lambda(\theta_\star)$, $t_0(\theta_\star)$, and $q_0(\theta_\star)$
curves, with the corridor highlighted.

To go beyond background expansion we compute, in R15, the linear growth
factor $D(a;\theta_\star)$ for each FRW model in the band, normalised so
that $D(a=1)$ coincides with the Einstein--de Sitter growth when
$\Omega_\Lambda=0$.
Within the observable corridor the late--time growth suppression at $a=1$
falls in a relatively narrow range,
\begin{equation}
  D_\mathrm{rel}(a=1;\theta_\star)
  \equiv \frac{D(a=1;\theta_\star)}{D_{\mathrm{EdS}}(a=1)}
  \simeq 0.73\text{--}0.83,
\end{equation}
with a mean around $D_\mathrm{rel}\simeq 0.77$.
A representative point near the original Act~II median,
$\theta_\star\simeq 3.6~\mathrm{rad}$, yields
$(\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda)\simeq(0.29,0.71)$,
$t_0\simeq 13.6~\mathrm{Gyr}$, $q_0\simeq -0.56$, and
$D_\mathrm{rel}(a=1)\simeq 0.77$.
The corresponding $\theta_\star$--dependent growth curve is plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:theta-star-linear-growth}.

The status of these constructions is deliberately modest.
Once the overall scale $S$ linking the microcavity shift to $\rho_\Lambda$
is fixed at a single fiducial point, the non--cancelling principle and its
$\theta_\star$ dependence nevertheless induce a structured band of effective
vacuum models in which late--time expansion and linear growth are broadly
compatible with an accelerating, $\Lambda$--like universe.
In this sense the observable corridor can be viewed as a first, qualitative
consistency check on the bridge:
starting from a phase $\theta_\star$ pinned down by flavour data and a
phenomenological non--cancelling rule in a toy microcavity, we can propagate
that information to FRW--level observables without encountering glaring
conflicts with the basic features of the observed universe.
A genuine prediction of the cosmological constant would require a more
microscopic model of the cancellation system and a fit to real data, which
we leave to future work.
