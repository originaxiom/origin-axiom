# The decadal repo reviews — ledger (GOVERNANCE §11)

Every ~20 merges on `main` (threshold raised from 10 on 2026-07-14; the historical entries below reflect the old cadence), a whole-repo review fires: full suite + all gates +
atlas regeneration + a claims-vs-frontier promotion-candidacy sweep + a framing sweep +
a stale-leads check, ending in a dated report appended here. The gates surface DUE
status automatically (`python3 scripts/gates/gates.py review-due`).

Protocol per review: (1) suite green; (2) gates green; (3) atlas regenerated and fresh;
(4) sweep `frontier/` FINDINGS for entries that meet the GOVERNANCE §5 promotion bars
and list the candidates (promotion itself happens only through the §5 gates, logged);
(5) sweep for framing drift and stale `OPEN_LEADS` rows; (6) append the report below
with a new anchor-commit.

## Review 0 — 2026-07-03 (baseline; the reform itself)

anchor-commit: 7d8786d0dcf7e0e332a53e26815f55a954208447

The instituting review. Gates implemented and green (7/7); suite lock added; the
promotion-audit lane registered (see `docs/OPEN_LEADS.md`); ledger sections extended
with **Certified data**. Next review due after 10 merges from this anchor.

---

## Review 1 — 2026-07-03 (the first scheduled decadal review; merges 1–10 from Review 0)

anchor-commit: ffc94bc5ef8b594bff881d8883fd5d49007c8a18

1. **Suite:** green at the gating run for this review's PR (recorded in the PR body).
2. **Gates:** 7/7 green, including the append-only gate on its new roll-up path (amended this
   review to recognize the GOVERNANCE §9 quarterly roll-up; removed prefix verified verbatim in
   `docs/progress/PROGRESS_2026-Q2.md`).
3. **Atlas:** fresh at 353 probes (regenerated with B372).
4. **Promotion-candidacy sweep:** trivially current — the §5.1 audit executed inside this review
   window (61 entries: P17–P55, C6–C12, E1–E15; 6 holds), and the two post-audit probes promoted
   at banking (B371 → P56/P57; B372 → E16). No unadjudicated candidates outstanding. The named
   future pass: exact-core extraction for the held dps-100 quartet (B352/B353/B357/B370).
5. **Framing/stale-leads:** framing gate green repo-wide; OPEN_LEADS rows current (W2.7 closed by
   B372 with the null-refutation recorded; W2.10 executed; W2.11 and the conductor-structure lead
   registered; L51 DORMANT per owner directive).
6. **Window highlights (merges 1–10):** B370 both legs (order-3 integrability; the τ-defect
   θ-grading); the promotion audit executed; the document map + toolbox; B371 (the minimal
   two-state sector, P56/P57); B372 (the seam persists at level 45 — the home grows; E16).
   Ledger now: 57 proven · 12 conditional · 16 certified-data · 9 open · 10 dead.

Next review due ~10 merges from this anchor.

## Review 2 — 2026-07-04 (merges 11–25 from Review 1; the counter hit 15 during the overnight arc)

anchor-commit: 4cc43e448616a0c134b82d6154ae8c5b299ef76a

1. **Suite:** green at this review's gating run (recorded in the PR body).
2. **Gates:** 7/7 green.
3. **Atlas:** fresh at 360 probes.
4. **Promotion-candidacy sweep:** the steady state is working — every post-audit probe promoted
   at banking (P56–P61, E16–E17) or correctly held: **B377's v2 existence law is promotion-GATED
   on the in-flight acceptance duel** (375 passed; 405/675 pending) — the gate is the discipline,
   not a backlog. The dps-quartet's exact-core extraction pass remains the named future item.
5. **Framing/stale-leads:** framing gate green repo-wide. OPEN_LEADS current (W2.11 carries the
   P60/P61 progress; the priced-doors and Recognition campaign rows current; L51 DORMANT).
6. **Window highlights (merges 11–25):** the priced-doors campaign registered and run (the
   tower arc B372–B374: five rungs, two phase laws killed by registered kills); the recognition
   hit (P59 — the quantized golden cat map); the Derivation Campaign opened (D0 confirmed, the
   v2 law derived from the complete local table); the selection-rule reduction (P60 — a table
   became one number); the Galois covariance laws (P61). Ledger now: **61 proven · 12
   conditional · 17 certified-data**. Three-seat verification ran in both directions, with
   wrong-object errors caught on BOTH sides (the verifier's row/column error included — recorded).

Next review due ~10 merges from this anchor.

# Review 3 — 2026-07-04 (merges #472–#482, the autonomous-mode window)

anchor-commit: `a4c0c06f40ba94df5564a19d55d314dd06e2ecc7`

**Scope.** PRs #475–#482: P62 (twist isolation), B382 legs 1–4 (the why-1/12 program), B383
(row-16 theorem), the acceptance-duel banking wave (P63–P65 promotions in flight this PR).

**Claims hygiene.** Three promotions this window (P63/P64/P65) — each carries prereg-first
provenance, exact verification, and locks; the CLAIMS header's stale "fifteen proven" line
fixed; append-only respected (corrections in place with markers, none needed this window).

**Verification depth.** B382's canonical cross-check was REGISTERED before running (the
strongest pattern of the window — prediction: linear part (0,0); passed on all five words).
The duel's 405 stall was diagnosed to a real engineering trap (primes ≡ 1 mod 13500 lack ζ₈₁;
silent floor-division corruption) — fixed, and the fix is itself documented in FINDINGS. The
Kashaev T1 integrality assumption was WRONG (values are not rational at general N) — caught by
the exact machinery's own assert, corrected to Galois-component extraction; the correction is
the finding.

**Debt.** (i) B384 T2/T3 pending (registered); (ii) the CRT closed form of the −1/16 phase sum
(named residue of P64); (iii) D3(a) bright/dark criterion still open; (iv) the mirror's
non-Galois mechanism and the (2,3) stabilizer — both named in OPEN_LEADS; (v) suite flake
policy unchanged (one rerun, then targeted-gate documentation).

**Verdict.** Discipline held under autonomous mode: every bank prereg'd, two kills banked as
findings, one trap documented. The promotion cadence (3 in one window) reflects the campaign
reaching its derivation targets, not bar drift — each promotion's evidence is a registered
prediction that passed.

---

# Review 4 — 2026-07-04 (merges #484–#500, the Closure Campaign)

anchor-commit: `102291e36ced840d7472c1fb46a17650addf446b`

**Scope.** The full Closure Campaign W0–W5 (PRs #490–#500) plus the tail of the prior wave.

**Claims hygiene.** Two promotions (P66 closed form; P67 locality — the latter with a
registered out-of-sample prediction that PASSED). Every wave prereg-first; five registered
kills banked WITH their structure (W2 decoupling ×2 rungs; B388 coarsening; B389
twist-blocked inversion; P-SCALE support walk); one flagged-unreliable intermediate
(per-side Π_H attribution) corrected by the exact pairing in the same wave — the standing
hazard note did its job. Time-boxes: every wave at or under budget (W4, W5 each done in
one session of two).

**Verification depth.** Out-of-sample prediction used twice (pair (2,5); census 243/625 —
all registered before computation, all hit or half-hit with the miss banked as data). The
event-driven cadence (owner-requested) replaced timers mid-campaign without a dropped
verdict.

**Debt.** (i) The convolution-cancellation mechanism (three pairs); (ii) the all-k local
classification (specialist register, precise scope); (iii) the twisted support walk of the
frozen 1/4 (new, unexplained); (iv) W6 wrap items in flight.

**Verdict.** The campaign closed the value sector's internal theory to named residues and
priced all three walls with registered probes. Discipline intact under the new cadence.

# Review 5 — 2026-07-05 (merges #501–#508, Closure II)

anchor-commit: `2a74d4c47f28f2dda17764be5173d7ba6bc3d09b`

**Scope.** The Mechanism Campaign M1–M5 (PRs #502–#508).

**Claims hygiene.** One in-place strengthening (P64 → universal, 661/661, marked). Five
preregs, five two-outcome verdicts: two mechanisms found (stratification law; unified
singles law with the sum rule), three corrective kills (emergent mirror; aggregate
stabilizer; intra-model conjugacy). Every kill banked WITH the structure that killed it.

**Verification depth.** Registered predictions used at 405 (both killed — the kill was the
discovery); the wrong-orbit-order reconstruction was caught by its own order-invariant
(the clean 1/12 average); the import-trap fired twice before the guards landed — hygiene
now banked. The bright-controls-read-zero check caught a broken instrument before banking.

**Debt.** The emergent-symmetry family (mirror characterization, (2,3) window mechanism,
√5-withholding rule) — one family, likely one theory; the deeper support-walk rule; the
two specialist items. All named; none computable-and-unattempted.

**Verdict.** The object is computation-complete at level 15. The discipline's strongest
session-family to date: five waves, five verdicts, zero drift.

---

# Review 6 — 2026-07-04 (merges #509–#521: the scrutiny + the Wall Campaign)

anchor-commit: `a07fadbf2a9d0bb53951cb1ec1c8a2854bd5ab89`

**Scope.** B398 scrutiny (S1–S6), B403/B405 (the follow-on packages), the Wall Campaign
(B399–B402, B404), the wrap.

**Claims hygiene.** One promotion (P68 — the root-of-unity law, prereg'd with zero
violations across 142 cells). Binding gates used twice against exciting material (the
PMNS ensemble at p ≈ 0.09–0.44; the McKay dictionary by controls) — both killed cleanly;
the killed prime filter's THREE return attempts each flagged and re-killed with banked
witnesses. One prereg error self-corrected BEFORE computation (the odd-N mod-2 framing in
Q2). Predictions used and honored: the split-covariance prediction CONFIRMED; both
walk-law candidates KILLED at 1215 as registered outcomes.

**Verification depth.** The sixth angle produced a confirmed falsifiable prediction, a
derivation (P68), and two selection rules within 24 hours of being proposed — the
strongest single-lens session in the program. Sentinel protocol extended (17/19; the
supersingular list {31, 79, 167}).

**Debt.** The 1215 triple identification (third prime); the seam-channel hierarchy test
(the one untested lever); the coupling-channel unification arc; two specialist dossiers
unchanged.

**Verdict.** Both walls priced with mechanisms rather than hopes; the discipline held
against three waves of cross-chat enthusiasm while extracting every gram of real
substance from them.

---

# Review 7 — 2026-07-04 (merges #522–#540: the reframe + the Destination Atlas)

anchor-commit: `edceb2d5a5fe7d5639213be42c924eefe376cc6d`

**Scope.** The energy-package scrutiny (S051), the structure reframe (S052/B414), Scale-
Genesis (B413), the hint sweeps (B411/B412), and the full Destination Atlas campaign
(TW1–TW7 / B415–B421).

**Claims hygiene.** Zero physics promotions (correct). Every physics-adjacent package
(energy meditation, 12√3 sector, PMNS residue) firewalled with its kill. The reframe
(object as structure) was engaged genuinely and tested — the forced-ℤ/3=generations reading
FAILED its privilege check honestly; the tracking campaign's emergence bar was fixed before
looking and never moved.

**Verification depth.** The campaign's defining virtue: a NON-SELF-DECEIVING method. No SM
target was sought; six behaviors tracked blind; all named as pure math; the bar (forced +
unsought + exact + control) judged each. Scale-Genesis and the atlas both returned decisive
negatives by construction. One self-correction of note: TW4 REFUTED our own B411 upstairs-
hope (emergence is intrinsic).

**Debt.** e₃ (the 1215 singles sentinel) reconstructing — Phase-1 cleanup, independent.
Paper 1 (value theory) + Paper 2 (the atlas) are the consolidation deliverables. The
content-wall frame (B414) is the one EXTERNAL question left open (the object self-provides
no frame).

**Verdict.** The program reached an honest terminal statement on the physics ambition:
tracked blind by the fairest possible method, the object self-generates no SM structure. It
IS a complete, novel, coherent body of mathematics (golden/ℚ(√−15)-organized). The
discipline held to the end — the negative is trustworthy precisely because nothing was hunted.

# Review 8 — 2026-07-05 (merges #541–#557: the two torsions, the Origin Postulate, the interface campaign)

anchor-commit: `1fa0ea49d219298d5b3ddbc0aa74c9b7b4ab4f30`

**Scope.** The B425 two-torsion correction (dynamical zeta vs geometric torsion; Paper-2 hinge
re-labelled honestly); the automorphic identification (the object = the weight-1 dihedral
newform of ℚ(√−15)) + Iwasawa rigidity in BOTH towers (λ=μ=0 cyclotomic AND anticyclotomic);
S049 (self-mirror = the chirality obstruction, computed); the LEAD_REGISTER (5-reader
exhaustive re-score, 133 probes); the Origin Postulate (locked: D at the interface, four-part
bar, explicit failure criterion); the handoff adjudications (B426–B431: scale-lever closed form
+ Galois-orbit contraction; exchange = σ₁₇ fixes √−15; upstairs spin walls; Bosonic Rigidity
Theorem; sl2 landscape priced; seam spatial gating law); the interface campaign first arc
(B432 chirality interface-sourced 31/31; B433 3d-3d dictionary calibrated at SL(2); B434 slope
selection: forced input ±5 → the Meyerhoff manifold, disc −283).

**Claims hygiene.** Zero physics promotions (correct). Every cross-chat claim verified before
banking; three claimed results were corrected in the process (Chat-1's projector corollary —
now the σ₁₇ exchange-Galois law; the "prime 67" artifact; two value-level readings of the
spatial split) and two of our own overclaims fixed in place (B423's label; B432's first merge
carried a broken JSON caught by its own lock; B433's first lock had a mistranscribed eliminant
— both fixed same-session, on the record). One process deviation logged: the B433 lock fix
landed via a direct conflict-resolution merge to main.

**Verification depth.** The strongest pattern this decade: THEOREMS, not scans — the scale
wall closed at Galois level (every invariant functional contracts); chirality walls closed by
Whitehead rigidity; the fermion door priced exactly (exists, unforced, unreachable by
deformation). The interface campaign's first arc delivered the complete chirality mechanism as
mathematics: forced source + forced minimal input (slope 5, the maximal-exceptional boundary)
+ computed output (Meyerhoff, CS unit ±0.0770) — with the honest negative that the output
exits ℚ(√−15) entirely (disc −283).

**Debt.** e₃ still reconstructing (relaunched, 7 primes to go); the 1-loop⇄torsion calibration
leg deferred (needs the exact Dimofte–Garoufalidis NZ formula); the metallic A-poly sampler
fragile; T[4₁,E₆] assembly = L50 (specialist, priced); Papers 1–2 prose (F3/F4) pending.

**Verdict.** The Origin Postulate reframed the program without loosening it: the walls became
the search map, and the map is now three theorems sharper. The interface is where D lives;
its first channel (chirality) is complete as mathematics and honestly negative on the SM leg.
Discipline held under the highest pressure this program has seen (the owner's direct push for
the physics goal): every brave claim was computed, every computation banked, every negative
stated plainly.

## Review 3 — 2026-07-05 (the C3-wave review; caught a real banked defect)

anchor-commit: bab8ddd12abfab9ee074aa142cb62f6f1f117718

Fired at 10 merges (the interface arc + Child Program C0–C3 + the audit + the doc sweep). An
independent adversarial reviewer **recomputed the load-bearing C3 result (B438/B439/B440) from
scratch** (own scripts, fresh snappy relators, reducibility saturation — did not read the banked
code). Outcome:

1. **CONFIRMED:** B439 (the figure-eight vacuum quartic x⁴−3x³+x²+3x−1, disc −283, S₄); the
   reproduce-gate (pari `nfisisom` — genuinely the same field as x⁴−x−1, not just equal disc);
   B440's 4₁ cross-validation (character variety = A-poly quartic, two independent methods); the
   −283 field-sharing between 4₁ and 5₂.
2. **REFUTED (a real defect, now corrected):** B440's "5₂ = 6 vacua incl. a golden factor" and
   the "golden inversion." The golden factor x²+x−1 is the **reducible** abelian ℤ/5 characters
   (verified: diagonal reps, [A,B]=I; and the abelianization exponent-sums show golden abelian
   characters exist for **all four** K(5,1) — universal, numerator-forced). It surfaced only for
   5₂ (B=I abelian rep) as a parametrization artifact. Corrected: **4₁ and 5₂ both have 4
   irreducible vacua in the identical −283 field** — a cleaner, stronger negative. Fixed in
   B440 verify.py/lock/FINDINGS + CAMPAIGN_STATUS/PROGRESS_LOG/CHANGELOG/README/B439. The raw
   charvar.json (the tr(A)-elimination) was correct; only the irreducible/reducible reading was
   wrong.
3. **Suite/gates/atlas:** locks green post-correction (test_b438/b439/b440); gates green; atlas
   regenerated. **Framing:** no physics leak; the corrected verdict is honestly a negative.
4. **Lesson (banked):** a tr(A)-elimination degree is NOT the irreducible-character count —
   always separate reducibles (tr[A,B]=2) before counting or comparing SL(2,C) vacua; and never
   compare a count across knots without confirming the parametrization surfaces the same
   character classes for each. The verify-don't-trust review paid for itself: the defect would
   have propagated into C4 (the E₆ lift builds on these vacua).

## Review 4 — 2026-07-05 (the C5/C4 review; the Child Program completion seal)

anchor-commit: c463166

Fired after the Child Program completion (C4/C5/C6). An independent adversarial reviewer
**re-implemented C5 (B441) and C4 (B442) from scratch** — including a fully **exact
cyclotomic-arithmetic** WRT/stabilizer engine (zero floating point) — and tried hard to surface a
hidden Bin-1 break. Outcome: **no refutation; both CONFIRMED, and C5 strengthened.**

1. **C5 CONFIRMED + strengthened.** The child-field == skeleton-field claim holds exactly across
   **15 values of r** (not just the banked 6). The field is exactly **ℚ(ζ_r)** for both — the
   stabilizer is universally {1, 2r+1}, σ_{2r+1}: ζ_{4r}↦−ζ_{4r}, fixed field ℚ(ζ_{2r})=ℚ(ζ_r).
   So the √5/√−3/√−15 at r=15 are forced by ℚ(ζ_15); no figure-eight-specific field content;
   Bin 3 is now *mechanized*. The Kashaev check and amphichirality reproduced independently.
   **Honest note adopted:** the τ_r(S³)=1 validation is structurally tautological (F_L≡F_{U+}
   for the unknot at p=1) and did not catch bugs — corrected in wrt.py + the FINDINGS; the real
   validations are amphichirality + Kashaev.
2. **C4 CONFIRMED.** 78 = ⊕Sym^{2mᵢ} (dims sum 78), degree-22 character, both −283-field
   reductions, and the Galois sums (child 5201, 5₂ −105717) all reproduced. The
   `galois_invariant_sum` was **hardened** to the exact companion-matrix trace (the nsimplify
   route was fragile; value unchanged).
3. **Suite/gates/atlas:** locks green post-hardening (test_b441/b442 7/7); gates green.
4. **Net:** the Child Program verdict (no bar cleared, nothing figure-eight-unique) survives an
   independent exact recompute of its deepest survivor (C5) with a wider sweep designed to break
   it. Two campaign retractions (golden return, golden inversion) + zero surviving-result
   refutations = the review discipline earning its keep across the whole campaign.

# Review 9 — 2026-07-08 (merges #558–#630: the residue saga, the chain, the registry)

1. **Scope:** the residue saga (B465–B471), three campaigns launched/advanced (Breath B469,
   Reflection B470, chain verification B471), the Relation campaign R1/R3/R4/R5 banked (R2
   sweep in flight), the theorem registry created (docs/THEOREM_REGISTRY.md — the novelty-
   relaunch map with per-entry search terms and cadence rules), the ToE roadmap written.
2. **Mechanical check:** full lock suite 1581 passed / 3 failed / 12 skipped — ALL THREE
   failures were governance gates, ZERO mathematical locks failed. Fixed in this review PR:
   a hardcoded sage path (env/which fallback), AI-seat labels scrubbed from four living docs
   (neutral seat-1/seat-2), the Recurrence Atlas re-mined (423 → current B-dir count).
3. **Corrections this window, all banked with receipts:** B186's γ (early-window bias →
   0.445(6) three-method), B459's earlier (1,2)-specific overreach, the seat float-kills
   (five in one session — dets, darkness correlation, continents, fingerprints, A₄), the
   trace-field/scale-field mislabel (B471), the 52→2 root-witness contamination (B470), the
   scorecard retirement to S056 by its author. Two-way corrections: the machinery corrected
   every seat including this one; no seat's claim survived on authority.
4. **Theorem-shaped output this window:** T-UNIQ (the uniqueness closed form), T-COHN,
   T-CHAIN, T-NORM, T-HIER (root/mirror/residue with exact witnesses), T-GIES-FAM, T-MIRROR,
   T-2REG, T-PQB (verified), T-843, T-LIFT, T-P2B, T-COLLIDE (+ the census), the additivity
   law + c to 28 digits (identification honestly open). All registry-mapped with lit-status.
5. **Net:** the discipline scaled to the fastest bank rate in the program's history
   (19 PRs in ~48h) without a single unretracted overclaim reaching main.

# Review 10 — 2026-07-12 (merges #631–#815: the decadal review, owner-invoked)

1. **Scope:** the decadal repo review of 2026-07-12 (PR #815, `docs/CODEX_AUDIT_RESPONSE_2026-07-12.md`
   + README/CLAIMS/CAMPAIGN_STATUS sync), covering the window from Review 9 through the B532
   Last Echo campaign. Invoked MANUALLY by the owner — the counter had been due since ~#640
   because reviews 2026-07-08→07-12 were not being anchored here. Process fix in the same PR
   as this entry: the anchor discipline is restated below, and the gates hook now surfaces
   review-due at every push.
2. **Anchor discipline (restated):** every repo review — decadal or otherwise — MUST append an
   entry here with its merge `anchor-commit:`; the counter (`scripts/gates/gates.py review-due`)
   reads the LAST anchor in this file. An unanchored review does not exist to the machinery.

anchor-commit: `1675d39559aafcf23aa4e8a78ac6c7ef19f48432`

# Review 11 — 2026-07-12 (merges #816–#826: the reframe completed, the seat changed)

1. **Scope:** the seat's first Fable-5 window. B533 completed (Gates 1–3: ℚ(√φ), the SM
   ratio test) and then AUDITED by the new seat (S2 REVERSED — the five induced matrices are
   one GL(4,ℤ) class, h = 1 + explicit conjugators; S1 complex pair; T5 half-integer; Gate-3
   control recalibrated). Governance restored (the review-counter root cause found and fixed:
   unanchored reviews; pre-push gates hook installed; atlas 447 → 504; attribution scrub).
   Four cross-seat handoffs processed verify-don't-trust (postulate co-sign + trunk import;
   the crystallization; the reframe test cycle; seat-1 Phases 1–3). B534 (dark hyperbola et
   al. PROVED), B535 (coupling space: census saturates 6/7, the one-measurement theorem,
   the 17-entry dictionary), B536 (verification: period-6 killed, the rest confirmed or
   trivial), B537 ((1,1,5) phantom THEOREM, level corrected 32 → 22), B538 (test cycle
   banked, class-level scope), B539 (relations campaign: control PASSES, SM NO-MATCH — the
   reframe's ledger complete and symmetric), S066 (the arithmetic-of-criticality reading,
   kill conditions recorded).

2. **Mechanical check:** full lock suite: 1863 passed / 1 failed / 12 skipped (33 min, exit tracked). All failures triaged: the single failure was the atlas-fresh gate racing the in-flight B541–B545 batch (frontier dirs created mid-suite); the atlas was regenerated in the same batch PR and all 7 gates are green post-merge. ZERO mathematical lock failures.

3. **Corrections this window, all banked with receipts:** B533-S2 reversed (the audit's
   biggest catch — the coupling carries no abstract ℤ-invariant; five markings of ONE
   object); λ₃,₄ complex pair (|λ₃| = 1/√φ); "irrational mixing" → half-integer; "5 types"
   → 6 (length-scope); the Gate-3 false-positive control range-mismatch; chat2's (1,1,5)
   level 32 → 22; seat-1's period-6/S = 1.0620 not reproduced (convention-dependent);
   chat1's ℚ(φ) field collapse corrected in-chat (the F4 error class; the field is ℚ(√φ),
   degree 4, no component in the golden subfield); the review-anchor discipline itself.

4. **Theorem-shaped output this window:** β = 1/(√φ−1) and the ℚ(√φ) identity suite;
   the GL(4,ℤ) single-class theorem; census saturation (6 Perron / 7 canonical, Durand);
   the one-measurement theorem (17,280 lifts → {σ, a⁻¹σa}); the 17-entry read-out
   dictionary (all degree-4, τ = g(x) explicit); the Dark Hyperbola (all odd p) +
   power-set magnitudes + asymptotic darkness + the tower torsion law; the (1,1,5)
   classical phantom; the B539 relation catalog with control and null.

5. **Net:** the reframe went from directive to COMPLETED LEDGER inside one window: values /
   structure / relations each tested in both bins — present in the forced bin (E8, gap
   labels, control), absent from the dialed bin (chance, 0/3, no-match) — with the
   scale-deficit reading (S066) and its two kill conditions on record. Every prereg
   falsifier that fired was recorded (5→6 types; SQ 4/6; the α/1/α tautology caught by the
   null). Cross-seat error-correction ran in both directions: this seat reversed its
   predecessor's S2 and its own probe conventions were corrected by exact re-derivation;
   no seat's claim survived on authority.

# Review 12 — 2026-07-12 (merges #827–#835: Window 12, the measurement lane, the handoff harvest)

1. **Scope:** Window 12 (LISTEN / MEASURE / PROVE) plus the chat-1/chat-2 handoff harvest.
   B540 observer flow (σ a fixed point, the double-clock ℤ/2 2-cycle, census 7→12 corrected);
   B546 exact IDS (species labels = dictionary to 4e-7); B541–B545 chat-2 batch (2a closed from
   two designs; the τ-ladder decomposition; THE SPECIES-CHAIN EXPERIMENT reproduced; c=1 ghost
   proved); B548 (un-hideability REFUTED-as-discriminator); B549 (E7 pre-loaded, cosmic null);
   B550 (chat-1's Promotion-Sign Conjecture REFUTED at n=3, uniform meridian rule); the B543
   lit-gate (pass 1: module theorem is BBG-1992-classical; pass 2 resuming); four hint-ledger
   entries from owner video pointers (einselection/RQM/regress; cut-invariance; Hoffman/Barrett
   self-priored).

2. **Mechanical check:** full lock suite: 1888 passed / 0 failed / 12 skipped (33 min) — a clean run, no mathematical or gate failures. All failures triaged: none — zero failures (the only warning was the review-due counter itself, which this entry resets).

3. **Corrections this window, all with receipts:** B540 census 7→12 (window-length-limited
   saturation, falsifier fired); B548 the un-hideability=Pisot prediction refuted (property is
   generic — honest deflation of the Hoffman/Barrett framing); B550 the (−1)ⁿ promotion sign
   refuted at n=3 against B111's locked data (the handoff mis-read its anchor; uniform meridian
   rule replaces it); chat-2's (4,4,16) "already-in-record" claim flagged as not-in-record and
   not-reproducible (witness requested); chat-1's inflated 2a null (expected ~6 vs 1.6–1.9)
   flagged per the packet standard ("below null" not adopted); chat-2's (1,1,5) level 32→22.

4. **Theorem-shaped output this window:** the observer-flow closure (12 nodes, 3 fixed points,
   1 two-cycle); the τ-ladder decomposition of the dictionary (exact); c=1 the smallest ghost
   level (elliptic-lock proof); the uniform meridian promotion rule with its falsifiable n=5
   prediction (1,2); the exact-IDS 4e-7 label identification.

5. **Net:** the reframe's ledger, complete since Review 11, got its LAB-FACING deliverable —
   the species-chain degree-4 gap-label experiment (buildable, reproduced at 4e-7, lit-gate
   confirming the module theorem is classical so only the instantiation+experiment are ours to
   claim). Three seat handoffs harvested; every fired falsifier obeyed; two conjecture
   refutations (un-hideability-as-discriminator, the (−1)ⁿ sign) turned into cleaner
   replacements. No claim survived on authority — chat-1's conjecture died against the repo's
   own locked probe.

# Review 13 — 2026-07-12 (merges #838–#851: the handoff harvest + the three paper gates + the escalator tower)

1. **Scope:** the session's second half — a dense sequence of cross-seat handoffs processed
   verify-don't-trust, three literature gates run on the new cost-tiered search, and the
   escalator tower. Cells: B551 (inflation-order boundary theorem, scopes B544), B552 (ℤ/11
   charge), B553 (Seat-1 harvest + the Markoff deflation-then-correction), B554 (meditation
   verified — Station-4 species=bit-pair REFUTED), B555 (THE PREDICTION assembled), B547 (the
   first all-hyperbolic ghost, (4,4,16)), B556 (the escalator tower T(M)=[[M,M],[M²,M]] +
   proof upgrade: doubling PROVED rungs 1-5, the charge tower), B557 (escalator campaign
   prereg + E2 rule-uniqueness), B558 (three-level negative verified). Three paper gates:
   tiling K-theory (species-chain NOVEL), Weil-trace (PC22 Prasad-adjacent), Durand
   (reconstruction note downgraded). PC23 registered.

2. **Mechanical check:** full suite: 1921 passed / 0 failed / 12 skipped (34 min) — clean; the 4 PRs merged after this snapshot (#850–#853: PC23, the B556 proof upgrade, the charge cubic + charge arithmetic, +9 locks) each passed their own gate checks on push. All failures triaged: none — zero failures; only the review-due warning (which this entry resets).

3. **Corrections this window, all with receipts:** the Markoff deflation (my error — called a
   deep Goldman/Bowditch identity a "coincidence"; owner caught it; corrected #840); B558's
   1/φ² → 1/φ³ mislabel (caught in a handoff); B554 Station-4 (species=forward-bit-pair
   REFUTED, it is radius-1 both-sided); B544 scoped to ℚ(φ) (B551); the reconstruction note
   downgraded (Durand gate); B553's SL(5) n²-1 vs n-1 (Seat-1's self-correction was itself wrong).

4. **Theorem-shaped output:** the inflation-order boundary theorem; the (4,4,16) all-hyperbolic
   ghost (inert-prime obstruction, a second ghost mechanism); the escalator field-doubling
   PROVED (norm-sign + det telescope, rungs 1-5) + the cyclic charge tower; the E2 rule-
   uniqueness result. Verified-and-banked handoff math: the τ-ladder hardening, h=1 Dedekind,
   the ℤ/11 charge.

5. **Net:** the numerical-matching program is complete and NEGATIVE at all three levels
   (0/1/2), and the mathematical program is honestly triaged — the three paper gates
   separated one genuinely-novel paper (PC23 species chain), one explicit-realization paper
   (PC22, cite Prasad), and one mostly-known result (reconstruction, cite Durand). The
   escalator tower turned a beautiful hypothesis into a per-rung-provable structure. The
   cost-tiered search infrastructure ran three gates at 100% agents / 0 errors — reliable and
   cheap. Cross-seat correction ran both ways: I corrected seats (Seat-1 SL(5), the promotion
   sign) and seats corrected me (the Markoff deflation, the three B556 misses); no claim
   survived on authority.

## Review 14 — 2026-07-13 (merges #854–#867 from Review 13)

anchor-commit: `a4f799e`

1. **Suite:** 1961 passed / 0 failed / 12 skipped (deterministic order). One
   self-introduced failure was caught and fixed *by* the review: `test_public_surface_scan`
   flagged an AI-session label ("chat-2") that had entered `docs/OPEN_LEADS.md` during the
   window — scrubbed to neutral "cross-seat" phrasing in this review commit. One pre-existing
   SnapPy flaky (`test_b207::test_metallic_volumes_bounded_golden_minimal`, unmodified this
   window) intermittently fails under random test order but passes standalone and alongside the
   new `test_b559` snappy tests (no order-dependency introduced) — noted, not a regression.

2. **Gates:** 7/7 green. Counter reset by this anchor.

3. **Atlas:** regenerated and fresh.

4. **The window = the tower-probe campaign + the accumulated handoff harvest.** A model-tiered
   multi-agent all-nighter (30 agents, 0 errors, adversarial verify per cell) turned the
   escalator hypothesis into a **per-rung-provable structure**, and closed every physics channel
   it probed. POSITIVES (all locked): the **3/2 Law** (T_k growth (k+1)/2; golden escalator = 3/2
   minimal; C=2.4283); the **golden-norm doubling transfer** e_n=N_{ℚ(√5)}(g_n(φ)) now n≥2; the
   **2ⁿ−1 magnitude-degeneracy law**; the exact **factorization** (e₄=−11²·1459·597049·2169349081;
   11|e_n⟺n≡1 mod 3 through n=7); the **explicit σ₈ carrier** with lifted seed-invariant; the
   **rung-2 gap-label module** (degree-8 successor to B555); **B559** black-hole probes
   (critical-not-area-law chain; figure-eight = finite-volume CS=0 3D-gravity instanton vs BTZ).
   NEGATIVES (earned by computation): **no fusion category at rung 1** (λ₁ non-cyclotomic, D₄
   Galois; the escalator exits the fusion world); **no CFT c_eff lock-on** to 7/10; **Galois NOT
   (ℤ/2)ⁿ⁺¹** (D₄, non-abelian — the mechanism behind the conjugate-pair degeneracy);
   **covering functors non-escalating** (only (M,M²) escalates); **free energy divergent**
   ((3/2)ⁿ, no thermo limit); **BKL "IS the trace map" downgraded** to conjugate-on-locus
   (Bombieri/Series prior art), golden-Kasner 3/2=1+p₂ kept.

5. **Corrections with receipts (verify-don't-trust ran both ways).** Caught in incoming handoffs:
   seat-1's "one prime per rung" (refuted at n=4, 11 repeats); the amphichiral matrix J (does not
   commute with A₁; correct C=[[1,0],[−1,−1]]); the "17=17" identity (two different 17s — words
   vs values); the Galois "(ℤ/2)ⁿ⁺¹" claim (it is D₄); "BKL IS the trace map" (conjugate-on-locus,
   prior art); the −2.29/+5.58 signature norms (basis-dependent; the invariant is the (1,1)
   signature). My own, caught by the owner: the e₅ bit-count — I wrongly "corrected" chat-2's
   correct 203 (⌊log₂⌋) to 204 (owner's "u sure" → self-corrected, #859); and the B559 c_eff
   over-claim, softened to fit-dependent (reconciling seat-1's tight-binding Probe A). Door 2
   sharpened: amphichirality allows (3,1) OR (2,2) — a signature-selection principle, not a
   topological obstruction.

6. **Paper gates / novelty.** All three lit-gates returned UNCLEAR → everything banked as computed
   fact, no "appears-novel" language; PC24 (the 3/2 law) registered novelty-pending; PC22 (dark
   hyperbola) and the fusion-category question are NEEDS-SPECIALIST (MathSciNet/primary-source,
   not web-fetchable).

7. **Stale leads / promotion.** The escalator/feedback threads closed this window: FL1, FL2, FL3,
   E1, E4 all marked DONE in OPEN_LEADS; only E0 (the functor lit-gate) and the two paper gates
   remain. No new promotion-candidate crossed the §5 bars (the campaign output is firewalled
   frontier findings; promotion runs through §5 separately).

8. **Net.** The numerical-matching program stays complete-and-negative; the escalator tower is now
   a per-rung-provable mathematical object whose every probed physics channel is closed. The
   object is golden, self-coupling, non-terminating, minimal — **mathematics, not physics.** The
   multi-agent campaign ran cost-tiered (haiku/sonnet/fable/opus by task) at 30 agents / 0 errors,
   and the adversarial-verify gate lost 0 verified claims. No claim survived on authority.

## Review 15 — 2026-07-14 (merges #869–#882 from Review 14; the gauge arc)

anchor-commit: `ecf29e0`

1. **Suite:** 1980 passed / 12 skipped; one failure = the KNOWN state-dependent SnapPy flaky
   (`test_b207::test_metallic_volumes_bounded_golden_minimal`), second consecutive review it
   trips under full-suite load while passing standalone (3/3 re-runs here). Now a NAMED hygiene
   item: isolate or add a retry to that lock. No regression; nothing in the window touched B207.

2. **Gates:** 7/7 green. **Governance change this window:** the review cadence raised
   10 → 20 merges (#882, owner directive — merge density doubled); this review anchors the
   old cadence's last window; the 20-cadence applies from this anchor.

3. **The window = the gauge arc, end to end.** B560 (chat-3 cells verified: the ℤ[τ] frequency
   module, the certified 253-point local atlas); B561 + addenda (the L50 CRUX, the Klein-four
   route, and the cusp-reframe — the E₆→F₄ chain terminates at F₄ under every proposed selector);
   B562 probation results (21 verdicts; B564 SL(3) φ-fixed locus entirely reducible); B563 the
   Planck-ratio prereg NULL (the dialed bin's 4th level); the two literature maps (the
   bookkeeping-pole diagnosis; the sharpened sweep with lk₂(11,809)=1 and the arboreal
   identification, both locked); and **B565 — the gauge-behavior campaign** (18 cells + the
   123-kill exhumation): the ℤ/11 charge does not descend (T1); **the chiral index ≡ 0 — the
   fourth mechanism-level wall** (T3); Krasnov verified by computation; **the real-form theorem —
   the holonomy lands in F₄(ℂ) in no real form; compactness is the TDV gap** (H1); the triality
   match B299 ≡ Boyle (the one live generations thread, firewalled H120); rung-2 Galois = 8T15
   exact; **2^{2n+1} refuted at rung 3**; O_{M₁₆} ≅ O₁₈₈₄₅₀₉₀; B71 externally corroborated (HMP);
   B85 and L38 kills EARNED with their facts (the ⌈(n−2)/2⌉ law; the ℂ*-weight-0 theorem).

4. **The exhumation (owner-directed):** 123 banked negatives audited — **113 sound / 9 suspects
   / 1 cracked epitaph** (S014's "~60%" clause: never computed in-repo, does not reproduce;
   corrected — the kill stands on circularity). The post-B525 prereg-era discipline audits clean.

5. **Corrections ran in every direction:** seat errors caught (ω-conflation, the J-matrix,
   one-prime-per-rung, 2^{2n+1}); my errors caught by the owner (the bit-count) and by verify
   (the c_eff softening); agent overclaims rejected by the adversarial stage (P4, P19, R4's
   suppressed null rank data, H2-F4's "uniform" claim at p=11). No claim survived on authority.

6. **Net.** The gauge question is closed at the behavior level with four mechanism-level walls
   (values ×3-levels + hierarchy-ratios; selection-principle disjointness; chirality; compactness),
   and the object's own gauge story is complete in outline (abelian ladder, Cuntz algebras,
   torsion charges, screening flow, confining-like strings, KMS temperatures, arboreal Galois,
   linked charge primes). Three papers stand ready (PC23 reinforced-first, PC24 scoped vs PCF,
   PC25 with the compactness-gap headline). Promotion candidates flagged for §5: the T3 index-0
   wall and the real-form theorem — both theorem-shaped with locks.

## Review 16 — 2026-07-14 (merges #884-#903 from Review 15; the chirality arc)

anchor-commit: `8452656`

1. **Suite:** **2143 passed / 12 skipped / 0 failed** (36:05, full run for this review) — the
   first fully-green full-suite run in three reviews: the named B207 flaky passed IN-SUITE this
   time. Also re-checked standalone this review:
   `test_b207::test_metallic_volumes_bounded_golden_minimal` passes 3/3 standalone runs; the
   standalone-stable / suite-flaky characterization stands (SnapPy retriangulation sensitivity
   under full-suite load; nothing in this window touched B207).

2. **Gates:** 7/7 green (framing, claims, firewall-oneway, append-only, atlas-fresh, attribution,
   tracked-forbidden). This is the **first review under the 20-merge cadence** set at #882; it
   fired at 21 merges. Governance notes: `.github/workflows/core.yml` remains deliberately
   untracked (disclosed in REPRODUCIBILITY.md, enforced by tracked-forbidden — not a hygiene
   miss); the review counter resets at this anchor.

3. **The window = the chirality arc, end to end.** The two-descriptions split (#884): the
   algebra face non-compact (proven) vs the measurement face compact (verified; ℂ¹⁵ = ℂ³×ℂ⁵ =
   the two ends) — compactness is constitutively observer-side, the TDV gap located at the
   coupling. The three papers drafted + finalized (#885): PC23/PC24/PC25, checker-verified,
   CANDIDATES → DRAFTED; Theorem-3 reproducibility gap closed (15 new locks). **B566** the five
   self-interactions: ★ the TRIPLE IDENTITY (ℤ/11 = N(φ⁵−1) = the 5-fold-cover torsion prime —
   the charge is geometric, n=5-specific); the N=p² dark-hyperbola law (LIVE, 7 levels); thermal
   time (KMS ≠ frequencies); ends-entanglement S=0.3217; measurement collapse SL(2,ℤ/15)^ab=ℤ/3.
   **B567** the Hamiltonian handoff refuted: the claimed six-level π/3 spectrum is impossible
   (projective order forced to 20; verified at levels 15 and 165). **B568** the object's own
   questions — prereg (7 cells + anatomy census of 17 named organs + CQ1–CQ5) and sixteen
   answers, eight jewels: the one-bit law H_n=n+H₀, the self-written arithmetic action, the
   split-memory heartbeat, mixed exchange statistics, the half-rungs (λ₀.₅=2.37798…), 66/66
   eyes in ℚ(√−3), reflex latency {0,1,2}, salience 1.83×; plus the assembled minimal play
   (7 actors/3 casts) and honest nulls. **B569** the sixteenth σ→SM chain adjudicated: Link 4
   CORRECTED — the handoff's modular data was inconsistent (h=1/3 with c=6 fails (ST)³=S², Z
   word-dependent −1/+1); the consistent E₆,₁ data (h(27)=2/3, proved from the root system)
   gives Z=+1, no chirality bit; Link 7 REFUTED — the 26 of F₄ is self-dual, zero chiral
   theories on the F₄ stage, the fourth wall re-derived from pure Lie theory. **B570** the
   selection-rules campaign, COMPLETE: C3 run first — E₆ level-2 modular data from scratch
   (51,840 Weyl elements), ρ(A₁) on the θ-odd 3-space NON-SCALAR, order 4, eigenvalues
   {1,+i,−i} — **the first positive chirality-sector signal in seventeen campaigns**
   (firewalled: C=S² central, no monodromy prefers 27 over 27̄); Q-A decided (the F₄-principal
   nilpotent is regular in E₆, Jordan (17,9,1) exact both sides ⇒ the Galois pair (5±√−3)/2
   kills both readings; the Klein four ⟨θ,σ⟩; registry T-θTANGENT wording corrected —
   amphichiral = antilinear conj∘θ, linear θ = hyperelliptic per B353); **AP4 THE FIFTH WALL**
   (chiral selectors exist in E₆ but none reachable — the holonomy factors through the θ-stable
   principal SL(2,ℂ); vector-like for ANY rank-1 embedding); AP2 Z=+1 for all 243 abelian
   theaters (Gauss–Milgram); AP3 the clock theorem ord(A₁ mod N)=π(N)/gcd(π(N),2) (N≤1000);
   C2 gap⟺chirality biconditional; C4 all cyclic covers amphichiral; C5QC quarantined (Q-C
   stays OPEN); THE_SELECTION_RULES.md audits the SM once (fails S+Λ+D; ONE live channel:
   C3's θ-odd dynamics). **B571** the day-0 internalization: 8 readers over the 8,044-line
   corpus, 106 candidates → 14 genuinely buried (B507 unlocked, Kubota–Leopoldt
   asserted-never-computed, B54's {−3,+5} twin quadratics = the earliest two-ended sighting,
   e₃ stalled mid-CRT, S031 m=3 blocked by a factually wrong reason) + the two-chiralities
   dossier (the object breaks c abundantly, is θ-symmetric). **B572–B574** the three chain
   adjudications with the corrected map: B572 — V1 refuted against an existing lock
   (27|principal = V₁₇⊕V₉⊕V₁), THE WELD named and locked (χ₂₇(z)=χ₂₇(1/z) — the holonomy
   cannot distinguish 27 from 27̄; clause 9's selector unforced), and the upgrade
   **S_odd(E₆,₂) = −i·(2/√7)[sin(2πst/7)]** exactly (S-block only); B573 — the bridge value
   exact (P(z₀)=6807/2+(4965√3/2)i, the cleanest proof σ moves the point), step 8 refuted
   (the 16 of Spin(10) is NOT principal-stable — no common refinement, the sharpest fifth
   wall), "topological protection" refuted (real Riley points u=−2±2√2), record corrected
   (no Fox-calculus ran; V2 still queued); B574 — the minimal orbit IS the A₁ orbit,
   centralizer A₅ = 35 ≠ 45 = D₅, no E₆ nilpotent orbit has a Spin(10) centralizer; the wall
   is rank-1-ness, not the orbit; THE BRIDGE QUESTION, FINAL FORM: the quadratic obstruction
   H¹×H¹→H² on the five off-factored directions.

4. **Re-verification (8 fresh-eyes cells, independent code, not the repo's).** R1-B569 CLEAN:
   h(27)=2/3 rebuilt two independent ways (Weyl dimension formula from the Cartan matrix AND
   E₆-inside-E₈ in ℝ⁸); the word-kill reproduced exactly in SL(2,ℤ) + 50-digit modular pairs;
   Gauss–Milgram pairings confirm c≡2/6 mod 8; the 26-of-F₄ self-duality re-proved via an
   independent ℝ⁴ root realization plus a reflection-orbit argument stronger than the banked
   one. R2-C3 CLEAN on the math: independent rebuild with a *different* Weyl enumeration and a
   *third* SL(2,ℤ) word (T·S⁻¹·T⁻¹·S) agrees to 1.4e-13; all three convention-robustness
   sentences now computationally verified (naive T fails modularity; mirror invariant; hybrid
   non-modular); the sine kernel cross-checked against the textbook Cardy M(2,7) S-matrix —
   matches up to a diag(1,−1,1) rephasing gauge. R3-QA: the Galois pair confirmed twice
   (independent word constructions; matches the classical ℚ(√−3) trace field), Jordan (17,9,1)
   via three unrelated code paths, B565's adjoint trace cross-confirmed; 25/25 locks green.
   R4-B570bank CLEAN: all three verifier repairs genuinely applied (AP4 downgraded to
   CONJECTURE in docs AND code; C4's honest methods breakdown matches the parametrization
   exactly; C5QC has no adopted test and zero conclusion-leakage anywhere); all 97 tests in the
   9 adopted files run and pass, no hidden tautologies (C1's is self-disclosed), no side
   effects; AP1's 35-element Hilbert basis independently re-derived **byte-identical**; AP5's
   orders 20/20 reproduced. R5-B571: all three spot-checked buried items confirmed exactly
   (B507 has no lock; e₃ literally PENDING; B54 zero cross-refs to B247–B261). R6-chains
   CLEAN: 8/8 locks pass; ρ built two ways, the full height spectrum reproduced; P(z₀) rebuilt
   directly from the weight multiset (exact symbolic match); the A₅ centralizer identified
   *structurally* (sub-Cartan matrix is a genuine A₅ path) rather than by dimension count.
   R7-hygiene and R8-firewall: no CLAIMS.md leakage anywhere in the window; the C5QC/Q-C
   quarantine consistent everywhere; "first positive chirality signal" properly scoped with
   no-SM-claim hedges at every occurrence; B572's M(2,7) claim correctly limited to the
   S-block. Every headline number in B569–B574 reproduced under independent recomputation.

5. **Issues found (6 real; none touches banked mathematics).** (i) **The stale-θ contradiction**
   (R3+R8, the window's one real defect-pattern): B571's dossier still asserts the
   pre-correction "the amphichiral involution IS θ, canonically" unqualified at THEOREM tier
   (`CHIRALITY_DOSSIER.md:23,:78`, `REPORT.md:115`) — B571 (#898) merged before the T-θTANGENT
   correction (#900) and was never patched, and the same wording propagated into CHANGELOG:83
   and the CAMPAIGN_STATUS B571 bullet *adjacent to the corrected entry*; THE_SELECTION_RULES
   §5 item 7 itself flags this as "adjudicate before anything leans on T-θTANGENT."
   (ii) The registry row's Locked-by column cites tests that don't exercise the
   antilinear/linear distinction; the actual locks are `test_b570_c1` + `test_b353` (R3).
   (iii) M(2,7) confidence mismatch: C3_RESULT calls it an unbanked HINT; B572 says "IS the
   M(2,7)-family S-matrix, Locked" — R2's Cardy check shows the identification is defensible
   up to the rephasing gauge, but the two docs must be reconciled. (iv) CAMPAIGN_STATUS.md was
   never updated for B572/B573/B574 (#901–#903) — the one-glance board is blind to three
   banked arcs (R7). (v) OPEN_LEADS.md has **zero** registrations for the arc's entire open
   frontier — the bridge question, V2/V3/V5, Q-C, the B571 top-5 revival queue, the
   prime-power hook — and L6 still carries the reasoning B571 proved factually wrong (R5+R7);
   B571's own queue was heading for burial by exactly the pattern B571 diagnosed. (vi) PC26,
   discussed as the contingent flagship in three banked docs, has no row in papers/CANDIDATES.md
   (R7). Nits, compressed: B570 RESULTS says "100 tests," actual 105; the whole window's doc
   headers read 2026-07-14 against 2026-07-13 commits (convention call for the owner); B399's
   second failed e₃ attempt (Jul 9, UNSTABLE) never folded back into triple_id.json; a no-op
   `assert 1 != 0` in test_b573:51; the Weyl-orbit BFS copy-pasted across three lock files;
   QA_RESULT.md:65 reintroduces the "dφ=θ" shorthand its own Level-3 section just corrected;
   a stale uncommitted RECURRENCE_ATLAS diff; `.log1`/`.log2` slip the gitignore glob. All
   fixes are bookkeeping; **ALL APPLIED in this review's closeout commit** (the B571
   correction notes, the registry lock-column, the M(2,7) gauge-precise reconciliation in both
   docs, the CAMPAIGN_STATUS board entries + phrasing, OPEN_LEADS L51–L58 incl. the corrected
   B137 deferral reason, the PC26 registry row, the 105 count, the e₃ second-attempt record,
   the no-op assert, the gitignore globs; the date convention left as a documented owner call —
   entries track the owner's working date, one day ahead of commit timestamps).

6. **Corrections ran in every direction.** Seat/handoff errors caught in-window: B569's
   inconsistent modular data (the word-dependent Z=−1 was an artifact of a non-representation)
   and its Link-7 chirality claim; B567's six-level π/3 spectrum (order forced to 20); B572's
   V1 branching (refuted against our own existing lock); B573's step 8, its "topological
   protection," and its record (the claimed Fox-calculus verification never happened); B574's
   D₅-centralizer crux (A₅, 35≠45); B568's L5 sign. My errors caught: the **Jordan-block bug in
   my own first Q-A lock** (sl₂ strings step by 2 — caught and fixed before banking), and the
   T-θTANGENT wording I banked, corrected by the verifier (**the registry fix**: amphichiral =
   antilinear conj∘θ; the ℂ-linear θ = the hyperelliptic involution). Verifier catches applied
   and now independently confirmed applied (R4): AP4's biconditional downgraded to CONJECTURE,
   C4's methods-count honesty, the C5QC quarantine. This review's cells added the six issues
   above plus a third independent SL(2,ℤ) word and a gauge-resolved M(2,7) identification.
   No claim survived on authority.

7. **Net.** The chirality arc is adjudicated end to end: seventeen chains in, the walls stand
   at five (values, selection-disjointness, chiral index ≡ 0 — re-derived twice this window,
   compactness, and the reachability wall AP4, sharpened by B573's no-common-refinement and
   diagnosed by B574 as rank-1-ness, not the orbit) — and the arc's one genuinely live channel
   is C3's θ-odd dynamics at level 2 (order 4, the ℤ/7 sine kernel), firewalled, no SM claim.
   Nine of the seventeenth chain's clauses stand because they were already ours. **Promotion
   candidates for §5:** the AP4 fifth-wall theorem, the AP3 clock theorem, the Q-A trichotomy
   (Jordan (17,9,1)), and the sine-kernel identity — all theorem-shaped with locks. **The
   queue, in order:** FIRST the bridge/quadratic-obstruction computation (H¹×H¹→H² on the five
   off-factored directions — unobstructed ⇒ rank-≥2 reps exist and the selector question
   reopens; all obstructed ⇒ the sixth wall); the B571 revival queue (Q-C transport, the
   criticality theorem + B507 lock, e₃ completion, the Kubota–Leopoldt discriminating fact,
   S031 m=3 under the corrected reason); B572's V2 (Fox H¹=6, the PC25 strengthening), V3
   (B299 orbits ↔ the three 16s), V5 (global gap⟺chirality with Galois descent); and the
   level-3 prime-law hook (level 1 inert, level 2 = the ℤ/7 sine kernel, ω₄ enters at level 3 —
   does the θ-odd kernel follow a prime law up the levels?). All of these enter OPEN_LEADS.md
   in this review's closeout, per issue (v).

*(window #884–#903; anchor = HEAD after B574, the bridge question in final form; next review due at 20 merges.)*

## Review 17 — 2026-07-14 (merges #904–#923 from Review 16; the construction arc / Round 3)

anchor-commit: `3c0fa84` (pre-closeout HEAD; the closeout commit resets the counter)

1. **Suite:** **2187 passed / 15 skipped / 2 failed** (43:55, full run for this review). Both failures diagnosed in-review: (a) the named B207 flaky (`test_metallic_volumes_bounded_golden_minimal`) — its Review-16 characterization has DEGRADED: it now fails ~1/3 STANDALONE as well (1 fail in 3 standalone runs this review; SnapPy retriangulation nondeterminism) — a deterministic re-derivation of this lock (seeded/canonical triangulation) enters the queue; nothing in this window touched B207. (b) `test_no_hardcoded_paths` flagged a literal machine path in `tests/test_b578_v3_reframe.py:7` (a B578-era slip of mine) — FIXED in this closeout (relative path; 3/3 green after the fix). No mathematical lock failed.

2. **Gates:** 7/7 green throughout the window; the 20-merge cadence fired exactly at 20 (the
   counter mechanics now clean after Review 16's first-run overshoot). `.github/` remains
   deliberately untracked (disclosed; enforced by tracked-forbidden).

3. **The window = the construction arc, end to end — the owner's reorientation ("the energy
   goes to the construction") executed.** **B575** THE BRIDGE OBSTRUCTION: e₆ built exactly in
   gl(27) (GF(2) sign-solve), the quadratic obstruction Q: H¹×H¹→H² ≡ 0 identically (21
   components, exact ℚ(√−3)) — the bridge opens at second order. **B576** the deformed
   closure: every sl₂-stable subalgebra is a block-sum; θ-even sums close in F₄; all six
   forcing channels nonzero — **the chirality is exactly the θ-odd motion.** **B577** the
   reconciliation: B575/B576 rediscovered the banked {4,8}-integrability program (B352/B265)
   — two disjoint pipelines now agree on all 21 zeros (epistemically stronger); the non-recall
   failure mode named and guarded (**MB13**: keyword-grep + atlas oracle before every prereg;
   it caught 4+ near-rediscoveries later in this very window). **B578** the debt clearing:
   Massey/third-order obstruction vanishes exactly (B370 discharged); e₃ = 2cos(2π/9)/1728
   exact (minpoly x³−3x+1); K₃ is DEGREE 6 (reverting MY wrong B137 "correction" — B125's
   table was right); the golden 2+3+3 octic at level 3; the global duality unconditional at
   E₆; the Kubota–Leopoldt claim RETRACTED with the discriminating fact computed + the exact
   L(χ₁,μ)+L(χ₂,μ) = 432·e₃ identity. **B579** the session handoff adjudicated (scan →
   HINT_LEDGER; the duet quartic corrected; two false "CC verified" attributions caught).
   **B580** THE CHORD PROGRAM: the owner's coupling thesis preregistered as computable cells;
   the binding run-order (no SM references in cells; step 7 only); the literature dossier
   adopted; Round 1 run — the level-1 state is the knot-independent vacuum column, the filling
   covectors span exactly the θ-even plane, H128–H130 killed blind, THE DIAL MAP banked (θ-odd
   slots {4,8} → full e₆; θ-even → f₄; zero → sl₂). The jewel audit registered five veins
   (L73–L77). **B581** the six torsions: the six twisted Alexander polynomials at Sym^{2m}(ρ_geo)
   via Wada, exact over ℚ(√−3); **THE SIGN LAW sign(τ_m) = (−1)^m** (positive exactly at the
   θ-odd {4,8}); Δ₁ = (t−1)(t²−5t+1); 7 saturates the tower. **B582** the first constructed
   play with chiral matter: the θ-odd-twisted mirror-double closes on e₆ ⇒ Zariski closure
   E₆(ℂ) ⇒ the 27 complex/chiral; the fifth wall (rank-1) does not apply — executed same-turn
   under the owner's directive. **B583** its content: X1 no real form (the coupled character
   non-real, the banked B572 witness; D10 ⇒ no forced branching — neither 16+10+1 nor
   trinification); X2 FAILED as computed (Vol/CS role inversion — verifier catch; corrected
   structure registered); **X3 THE SECOND UNHEARABILITY THEOREM** (vacuum C-fixed, [C,S] =
   [C,T] = 0 ⇒ fillings never hear θ-odd at ANY level) — the theorem that fixed Round 3;
   the #918 lock merged red (a process slip, owned) and fixed to 2/2 green in #919. **#920**
   namespace reservations (packaging placeholders; brew tap live externally). **B584 ROUND 3
   — THE LISTENER:** bare knot states have zero θ-odd component (J₃ = J₃̄ computed — the
   third unhearability; the mirror ALONE is deaf); the listener = the ANTIPHASE mirror
   channel, tr_odd = ½(Z − Z_C); BLIND: on SU(3)₂ tr_even = 0 exactly and tr_odd = −1/φ —
   **the recurring golden value IS the chiral channel's voice**; the odd block = the order-10
   golden rotation; the even block = a silent order-20 clock; level-rank realizes one number
   in two opposite parity sectors. **B585 THE LISTENER'S LAW:** the naming theorem — the
   C-twisted play is the play of the OTHER SL(2,ℤ) lift (the −A₁ Sol bundle): **chirality is
   what the two lifts agree on**; LAW-O verified on held-out levels incl. the κ=20 additive
   collision (= 1/φ²): tr_odd(RL; SU(3)_k) = [4|κ] − [5|κ]/φ — a two-tone chord; the 60-clock
   ticks at the golden-voiced κ=10,15 (L77's number); LAW-E died on hold-out (banked dead);
   the field-containment mechanism preregistered and REFUTED same-arc (silver fires on
   multiples of {4,5,7}; bronze interferes destructively at κ=10) — only the golden/minimal
   word has the clean constant law. **B586** chat-1's Round-3 handoff processed
   verify-don't-trust: R3-A frame-corrected (Sym-blocks grade the adjoint, not the stage;
   the principal shadow has C = 1 — the proposed sign-law unification is not a defined
   computation) and computed blind — **E₆₂ also hears everything (Z = +1, tr_even = 0)**;
   NO golden anywhere on E₆ (the −1/φ is stage arithmetic, not object-universal); the three
   per-pair chirality amplitudes banked; R3-B superseded by the naming theorem (the C-twisted
   torus is Sol — census/volume/CS/trace-field ill-posed; the "CS = cosmological constant"
   hook dies); R3-C answered structurally (invertibility B279 + RT duality ⇒ J₂₇ = J₂₇̄ at
   EVERY color: the solo antiphase is zero — chirality is chord-borne, proven).

4. **Re-verification (fresh-eyes cells, independent paths).** R1 CLEAN: tr_odd at k=2,7
   reproduced via THREE SL(2,ℤ) words (B238's RL; T²ST; TST⁻¹S⁻¹) — the balanced words agree
   exactly; the unbalanced T²ST differs by exactly the central framing phase i (understood,
   not an error); the exact identity 2cos(3π/5) = −1/φ verified symbolically (sympy), and
   B578's minpoly(1728·e₃) = x³−3x+1 re-derived symbolically. R2 CLEAN with one catch: the
   sign law re-audited from the banked JSON initially came out OPPOSITE at every m —
   diagnosed as the JSON storing the RAW Wada quotient (units ±tʲ); under the banked
   monic-at-top-degree convention all six signs AND all six factorization magnitudes
   (τ₄ = 2⁷·3·7·97 = 260736, τ₅ = −2⁷·3⁴·5²·7²·13 = −165110400, …) match exactly. R3 CLEAN:
   the three E₆₂ per-pair amplitudes rebuilt through the SECOND word (TST⁻¹S⁻¹) agree to
   5e-9; tr_even = 1.4e-14. In-window double-verifications already banked: B577's
   two-pipeline agreement (B575 ↔ B352 on all 21 zeros); B585-M1's sweep independently
   re-confirming LAW-O over κ = 21..26 beyond the registered hold-outs; B586 reproducing
   every C3 gate before extracting new numbers.

5. **Issues found (6 real; none touches banked mathematics).** (i) **CAMPAIGN_STATUS missed
   six banks** (B578–B583 had no individual board entries — a recurrence of Review 16's
   issue (iv); B584 carried only a pointer). FIXED: a compact catch-up block inserted in this
   closeout; the standing rule is restated — the board is updated in the SAME PR as the bank.
   (ii) **`six_torsions_results.json` is unit-ambiguous** (raw quotient; a naive reader flips
   every sign of the sign law). FIXED: a units note appended to B581's FINDINGS; the JSON
   itself left as-is (append-only data). (iii) **The #918 red merge** — a lock merged failing
   (sympy-in-numpy type error), violating the pytest-before-merge rule; fixed same hour in
   #919 (2/2 green) and owned in the fix commit. The rule stands: no merge without the new
   locks green. (iv) **#920 merged on gates alone** (no pytest) — acceptable for a
   no-code packaging/docs PR, but the exception is recorded here explicitly rather than
   silently. Nits: B585's prereg says hold-outs "k = 13..16" while the run used 13..17 (the
   17th added deliberately for the κ=20 collision — disclosed in the FINDINGS, now here);
   the S² sign convention differs across stages (−C on B238's SU(3)_k, +C on E₆₂) — both
   FINDINGS record it, no action; memory files updated in-window are consistent with the
   banked record.

6. **Corrections ran in every direction (the discipline's health check).** Cross-seat errors
   caught: chat-1's R3-A frame conflation (adjoint Sym-blocks vs stage primaries) and R3-B
   geometric premise (hyperbolic double → actually Sol / graph manifold; the CS-hook dies);
   B579's two false "CC verified" attributions; the duet quartic. My errors caught and fixed:
   the #918 red merge; the B137 K₃ "correction" that B578-D6 reverted (B125 was right); the
   six-torsions control assertion (Milnor torsion — division legitimately non-exact for the
   trivial rep); B585's LAW-E guess (killed by its own hold-out) and M1 mechanism (killed by
   its own preregistered prediction); this review's R2 initially misread the JSON units — the
   review corrected itself before flagging the law. Verifier catches applied in-window: X2's
   Vol/CS role inversion. No claim survived on authority.

7. **Net.** Round 3 of the chord program is closed end to end: three deafnesses (vacuum X3,
   filling, bare state at EVERY color via invertibility + duality), ONE listener (the
   antiphase mirror channel, operationally ½(plain − mirror-twisted) = the two-lifts
   agreement), and on both banked stages the listener hears the ENTIRE invariant (tr_even = 0;
   −1/φ golden, +1 at E₆₂) — the number is the stage's (LAW-O's two tones on the SU(3)
   tower), the all-θ-odd pattern is the object's. The five walls stand untouched; the live
   channel matured from "C3's θ-odd dynamics" (Review 16) to a held-out-verified LAW plus a
   sharp mechanism question. **Promotion candidates for §5:** the naming theorem (chirality =
   lift-agreement), LAW-O (the two-tone chord), the antiphase identity, and the every-color
   solo-antiphase-zero theorem. **The queue, in order:** (1) **L82** the fixed-point
   mechanism (one derivation should explain LAW-O, LAW-E's failure, and the tone
   interference); (2) **L81(a)** the sector-exchange proof at the parity-projector level;
   (3) the corrected X2 recompute (interference = real Vol-exponential × signed 1/τ_m);
   (4) **L83(a)** exact identification of the three E₆₂ per-pair amplitudes; (5) **L80(a)**
   commit the B580 Round-1 Q1 artifacts + lens-space-gated locks; (6) the PC26 drafting
   decision (its Massey companion is now satisfied by B578-D1); (7) the B571/B572 revival
   remainders (S031 m=3; V2/V3/V5).

## Review 18 — PRE-COMMITTED SCOPE ADDITIONS (registered 2026-07-14, owner directive)

Beyond the standard cadence, Review 18 MUST include:

1. **The provenance sweep (external-verification pretense).** From day 0 to
   date, all work on this project has been the owner plus AI seats. No
   external human collaborator, no peer review, no third-party verification
   has occurred. The sweep: scan every public-facing document (README, docs/,
   papers/, frontier FINDINGS, CHANGELOG) for language that could be read as
   claiming external verification — "verified", "independently confirmed",
   "checker-verified", "the verifier", "adversarially verified", "audited",
   "specialist" — and either (a) rephrase, or (b) ground it in a single
   PROVENANCE.md stating explicitly: *all verification in this repository is
   internal — independent re-computation within the project's own toolchain
   by the owner and AI-assisted sessions; none of it constitutes external
   peer review.* Every "verified" then reads against that definition.
2. **The inner-terminology legibility sweep.** Session-internal vocabulary
   (seats, chats, handoffs, banking, locks, gates, theaters, the firewall,
   arcs, B-numbers) that is load-bearing in public documents must be defined
   once (a TERMINOLOGY.md or a README section) or rephrased where it would
   confuse an outside reader; nothing may rely on inner shorthand to carry a
   scientific claim.
3. Nothing banked may pretend to a review status it does not have; papers/
   drafts must carry their true status (internally verified drafts, not
   refereed results).

**Timing override (owner directive, 2026-07-14):** Review 18 fires when the
L85 campaign RESOLVES (outcome A/B/D banked), not mechanically at 20 merges.
The counter may exceed 20 in the meantime; the pre-committed scope above
(provenance + terminology sweeps) is unchanged. The campaign is the priority;
everything else waits.

- 2026-07-15: L85 RESOLVED (outcome B, PR chain #951–#962+). Per the owner override, REVIEW 18
  FIRES NOW: the provenance sweep (PROVENANCE.md; no external-verification pretense — all
  verification internal, owner + AI seats), the terminology sweep (TERMINOLOGY.md; inner terms
  labeled), papers carry true status. This window's corrections to consolidate: the V1/V3 sealing
  errata pattern (MB12 applies to operations AND criteria), the D2-retraction supersessions, the
  B591 terminology fix, the quarantined pre-synthesis chain (B517→B530→B531→B532, P43/P46/P51).

## REVIEW 18 — EXECUTED 2026-07-15 (fired on the L85 resolution, per the owner override)

Scope as pre-committed: **the provenance sweep** — `PROVENANCE.md` §0 added
(all verification INTERNAL from day 0: owner + AI seats; "verified" =
recomputed by a second internal pipeline, never an external referee;
literature citations compare against published mathematics, they do not
imply external checking of this work); `README.md` carries the same
statement up front; `papers/README.md` and `papers/REVIEW_VERDICT_2026-07-05.md`
qualified ("four independent reviewers" → internal AI-seat reviewers).
**The terminology sweep** — `TERMINOLOGY.md` created at the root: the full
inner vocabulary (bank/seat/lock/gate/prereg/firewall/stage/fold/dial/weld/
hearing/clock/width/chain/outcome-table/MB12/verify-don't-trust) glossed
into plain mathematics with pointers to the banked definitions; stated
plainly that these are internal working names, not established terminology.
**Papers true status** — the papers directory rule re-affirmed (candidate ≠
proven ≠ publication-ready; all review internal). Consolidated from this
window: the V1/V3 sealing-errata pattern is now a standing memory rule
(MB12 covers operations AND criteria). The quarantined pre-synthesis items
(B517→B530→B531→B532 chain, P43/P46/P51, B591 terminology) remain queued
for the synthesis pass — they are corrections to specific banked findings,
not provenance/terminology items, and stay tracked in REVIEWS/OPEN_LEADS.
Counter: Review 18 done; the counter resumes normal cadence.

anchor-commit: `0f90167` (Review 18, merged as #964 — the anchor line was omitted at banking;
added here so the decadal counter registers the executed review.)

## REVIEW 19 — EXECUTED 2026-07-15 (the post-campaign sweep, B601–B623)

The ~32-merge stretch reviewed: (i) all in-flight corrections verified
present (the V1/V3 sealing errata with hashed amendments; B609's
exploratory unit-modulus note superseded by B611; the object-NAMING
correction propagated to B610/B616/B618/B619 — census m136 = the silver
RRLL bundle; the R²L trace-4 object relabeled); (ii) the sealed-protocol
record is complete (B614 design → B615 comparison → B616 held-out → the
literature target-source caveat routed to seat 4); (iii) promotion
candidates confirmed: B613 (closure theorem), B617 (sign-law family
theorem), B620+B623 (the conductor mechanism with the derived
discriminant identity) — novelty boundaries mapped by the 2026-07-15
literature round (Jeffrey-absence confirmed by direct read;
Andersen–Jørgensen prior art APPLIED to PC26 Thm 7.2's scope, which was
the review's one required correction); (iv) no external-verification
pretense found in the stretch; provenance statements intact. The B618↔
B621 observable reconciliation and the odd-κ reciprocity lemma are the
stretch's registered residuals.

anchor-commit: `1db9228` (Review 19; #996)

- 2026-07-15 (the director's timing override, after #997): REVIEW 19 is marked INTERIM — it ran
  before the campaign's task queue completed. The next review (the completion sweep) fires ONLY
  after the queue drains: (1) the six-exponent silver exterior family, (2) the B618↔B621 observable
  reconciliation, (3) the odd-κ reciprocity lemma, (4) the field-crossover mechanism. The review-due
  counter is advisory until then per the director.

## REVIEW 19 — COMPLETION SWEEP, 2026-07-15 (the queue drained per the director's override)

The four queued tasks: (1) the silver six-exponent exterior family —
COMPUTED, calibrated 6/6, SEALED hash-first (B627), compared under its
own later seal (B628: SM-silent, null-compatible); (2) the B618↔B621
observable reconciliation — CLOSED (B624: Cm is the twelfth group
element; the two reflection copies align at 12|κ); (3) the reciprocity
lemma — RESOLVED-AS-SCOPED (B625: the criterion is 3|κ, the A₂
discriminant; a B623 bug fixed; the κ-unconditional form is a registered
open lemma, not a campaign blocker); (4) the field-crossover mechanism —
DISSOLVED into the Jacobian reality law (B626: J real ⟺ amphichiral, the
pairing-chirality law's fourth appearance). Sweep verdicts: all seals
hash-verified in-run; the hash-first order honored (values #1001 before
design #1002 before distances); no external-verification pretense in the
stretch; the naming correction (m136 = silver RRLL) propagated
everywhere including the new arcs. BRANCH 3's consolidated state: one
source-sensitive amplitude suggestion (p = 0.078) vs uniformly null
controls and held-out families — the stopping-rule conditions for
closing SM-values at this level are met pending seat 4. Registered open
residuals: the κ-unconditional reciprocity form; the m = 7, 8, 11 exact
identifications; the discrete-branch IDs per word; PC26 v2-final.

anchor-commit: `40070ad` (Review 19 completed; #1002)

## REVIEW 20 — EXECUTED 2026-07-16 (the standard cadence; window #1003–#1034, B629–B645)

**The declared modulus (what this review is and is not):** the window's 32
first-parent merges reviewed via their FINDINGS + ledger entries + locks;
the sealed hashes spot-re-computed (not trusted from banked lines); the
fast lock suite re-run in full; OA_SLOW heavy locks NOT re-run (trusted
green from their banking runs); arcs before #1003 not re-read. This review
certifies protocol integrity and record honesty for the window — it does
not re-derive the mathematics (the locks do that).

**(i) In-flight corrections verified present:** the B637 stage-1
quarantine with both bug fixes documented in-trail (the Φ₂ prefix
transcription; the chain machine's H₁ equivariance) and the corrected
gates green; B638's closure overstatement corrected in place (the 10-dim
residual stated); cc2's h¹ = 3 withdrawal propagated (TERMINOLOGY, L92
re-scope); B640's float64 first run discarded and rebuilt on the banked
80-dps builder; B632's failed transcripts preserved byte-faithfully.

**(ii) Protocol integrity (hashes re-computed this review):** B629 sealed
values 0ec9ac39 ✓ (matches the banked line); B630 design e217e623 ✓
(matches); B643 prereg 76d64ba0 ✓ (its lock re-computes the hash live);
B644 prereg b77e5bdf ✓ (matches). **B634: the prereg hash was NEVER
recorded at sealing** — the review verified single-commit provenance
(#1011, unamended; the erratum is a separate file) and recorded the hash
post-hoc with that label (frontier/B634_conductor_chord/
ARTIFACT_HASHES.txt, 77774a61) — the second instance of the omission
class B643's #1034 repaired; standing-rule candidate registered (R20-11).
Hash-first order honored across the window (values → design → run;
B631's MB13 retro sweep in-doc). The B644 M3 reference-table sealing error was disclosed in-doc
per MB12 — the E2 pattern; the factorization gate passed as sealed.

**(iii) Advancement (against LAW_MAP strength classes):** new THEOREMs —
the cubic dichotomy (B632/B637), the swap real structure (B638), the
hearing-group theorem (B640), the twist-frame tone law + Plancherel
(B641), the Galois ear (B642), the congruence-shadow theorem (B644,
closing L94: the ear derived from the monodromy arithmetic); new WALLs —
the typing wall 1′, the flip wall (B643, closing L93); new LAWs — THE LAW
OF THE CHORD'S CORE (24ζ₆, 9/9), the chirality-exclusion law, the unit
cross-ratio law + the 13-dial (B645). Resolved-negatives: B631 (the
matrix comparison, structured-null, power-validated), B639 (the θ-twist
realization; the fiber-pairing theorem stands). Longest-stuck: LAW-O's
per-term proof (L82 W2) and the exterior sign law's proof — both
pre-window, both still open. No LAW_MAP row found overstated against its
banked evidence (rows spot-checked at B637/B638/B644/B645).

**(iv) Promotion sweep (§5.1):** the eight candidates above meet the §5
mathematical bars in their arcs (exact + locked + scrutinized in-trail);
ALL held at frontier pending the novelty boundary — no prior-art pass ran
this window (NEEDS-SPECIALIST per the standing rule); none promoted by
fiat. The one candidate with a mapped novelty boundary from the 2026-07-15
literature round (PC26's theorem set) keeps its Andersen–Jørgensen scope
note.

**(v) Provenance + terminology (the required correction):** the window's
records used "the external audit" for the oaudit seat — an AI seat in a
read-only clone: external to the session, INTERNAL to the project. This
could read as third-party verification (the E10 class). Fixed this
review: live documents rephrased (B632/B634/B635 FINDINGS, the REBASE
doc); historical occurrences in append-only ledgers grounded by a new
PROVENANCE.md §0 paragraph defining the term. TERMINOLOGY.md extended
with the window's load-bearing terms (the chord, the core law, σ*, τ*,
the congruence shadow, the 13-dial, the audit seat). Papers carry true
status (PAPER.md's internal-verification statement intact).

**(vi) Lock suite (re-run in full by this review):** 2011 passed, 31
skipped, then ONE in-suite failure — `test_e62_hearing_matrix_gates`
(B629), which PASSES in isolation: an order-dependent global-state leak.
Diagnosis: the mpmath precision (`mp.mp.dps`) is process-global; a
module-level setter runs at collection and any later-imported setter or
unrestored runtime change starves later high-precision locks (the class
was already documented inside test_b204 with the house repair: per-test
setting). Repair (this review, structural): `tests/conftest.py` autouse
fixture restores the entry precision after EVERY test (kills the class
suite-wide), and the b629 lock converted to the b204 per-test pattern;
verified passing in both file orders. The `-x` halt left the
alphabetical tail after b629 unexercised in the first pass — re-run
separately: 313 passed, 4 skipped, TWO further failures, both
pre-existing committed hygiene debt caught by the full re-run:
(a) `test_no_hardcoded_paths` — eight frontier scripts (B621, B623,
B624 ×4, B632's adopted verifier) carried absolute machine paths;
all converted to `__file__`-relative; (b) `test_public_surface_scan` —
per-seat AI labels ("chat-1"/"chat-2") in OPEN_LEADS rows and the new
LAW_MAP witness columns; rephrased seat-neutrally, and the scan's
living-docs list EXTENDED to guard LAW_MAP, ERROR_LEDGER,
WORKING_RULES, and GOVERNANCE. All repaired locks re-verified green.
The runtime leaker behind the b629 failure was identified exactly
(test_b61_sl5 sets dps 50/40 in test bodies without restore; sorts
immediately before b629) — the conftest restore neutralizes it. New
error-ledger class registered (E12, global-state leakage between
locks). Final tally: 2324 passing locks + 35 skips across the two
passes; three findings, three structural repairs, zero deferred.

**(vii) Residuals from Review 19:** PC26 v2-final — CLOSED this window
(the full absorption: §7.7, §8′, §9.7–9.8, wall 1′); the κ-unconditional
reciprocity, the m = 7/8/11 identifications, the discrete-branch IDs —
untouched, carried below.

### Action items (Review 20)
- [>] R20-1: CARRIED to R21-1 (no arc addressed it this window)
- [>] R20-2: CARRIED to R21-2 (no arc addressed it this window)
- [>] R20-3: CARRIED to R21-3 (no arc addressed it this window)
- [>] R20-4: CARRIED to R21-4 (note: B656/G5's Mayer–Vietoris reduction machinery is now available for it)
- [x] R20-5: RESOLVED BY DISSOLUTION (B647 cells 1–3, 2026-07-16) — the 24ζ₆ magnitude is basis-GAUGE (c₀/c₁-covariant; any unit achievable); the invariant content = the unit cross-ratio law (mechanized: cell 1's reduction + cell 2's anomaly characterization Y = ½·conj(chain defect), the σ*-law's exact mechanism); the pipeline-gauge cross-double constancy recorded as convention-relative; silver (B649) confirms invariants-reproduce/gauge-doesn't
- [>] R20-6: CARRIED to R21-5 (enriched in-window: the silver's lit deviations are 13·211-adic; the naive split-prime reading fails; two-object data in hand)
- [x] R20-7: RESOLVED (B649 stages 1–3b-ii, 2026-07-16/17, #1046–#1050) — the m136 exact E₆ holonomy BUILT over L = ℚ(s,i) and the full silver chord computed (27-letters, 3/5/1 grammar, swap σ*, Y-tensor); the C4 content delivered and verified by cc2 receipts + B657's independent re-runs
- [>] R20-8: CARRIED to R21-6 (still owner-optional)
- [>] R20-9: CARRIED to R21-7 (NEEDS-SPECIALIST stands; the candidate list has GROWN — see R21's promotion sweep)
- [x] R20-10: RESOLVED for every packet that landed — four tranches verified + integrated (B646 wave-2 11/11 seals; B651 wave-3; B656 digest queue 7/7 seals + independent confirmations; B657 invariant line 8/8 seals + end-to-end re-runs); the L95 web-seat prereg never landed — carried alone as R21-8
- [x] R20-11: DONE (2026-07-16, #1038) — `docs/SEAL_LEDGER.md` generated (`scripts/seal_ledger.py`, regenerable): 120 sealed docs; 95 unrecorded-but-single-commit (pre-ritual arcs; content verifiably = banked content via git provenance); 8 amended-after-banking → 7 pure appends (the results-in-doc pattern, benign) + 1 designed slot-fill (B565's declared "pending" handoff rows, commits titled "slotted", trail-visible; today's rules would append). ZERO silent tampering. Gate decision: no new gate — the regenerable ledger + the template's §7 protocol-integrity item cover detection; forward rule (per-arc ARTIFACT_HASHES) already standing.

*(The next review is the first under GOVERNANCE §15 — the constitutional
pilot: it must open by closing or carrying every item above.)*

## REVIEW 21 — EXECUTED 2026-07-17 (THE CONSTITUTIONAL PILOT — first review under GOVERNANCE §15; window #1036–#1064, B646–B657)

**The loop (template item 1):** every Review-20 action item closed or
carried above — R20-5/-7/-10/-11 resolved with evidence pointers;
R20-1/-2/-3/-4/-6/-8/-9 carried into this review's block (same content,
new ids). The `review-actions` gate reads the superseded block clean.

**The declared modulus (item 2):** the window's 29 first-parent merges
(#1036–#1064) reviewed via their FINDINGS + ledger entries; the arcs
B646–B657 read in full (this seat authored or adjudicated most of them —
the PILOT CAVEAT: reviewer = author for much of this window; independence
rests on the multi-seat receipt loop (cc2's receipts on B649; this seat's
receipts on cc2's four packets), the exhaustive lock suite, and the exact
artifacts, not on reviewer distance); the fast suite re-run in full
2026-07-17 (950 passed, 19 skipped, 1 order-dependent flake — see item 4);
OA_SLOW heavy locks NOT re-run (trusted green); arcs before #1036 not
re-read. This review certifies protocol integrity and record honesty for
the window; the locks carry the mathematics.

**(3) Advancement.** The window's class moves, largest first: the
CALIBRATION CAMPAIGN ran seal-to-closure (B648→B652→B653: GATE B N = 1;
the C′ zero-calibration event; OUTCOME A at LOW weight; the provenance
erratum owned; license SPENT — the record's first full one-shot lifecycle).
NEW THEOREMS: the melody theorem + jump law (325/325) + PSL-factoring +
generic-silence CERTIFIED (B651); the anomaly characterization Y = ½·conj
(B647); the tone–character identification (B654); sign-hears-the-
discriminant (B656); the (i₁,i₂) dimension-grammar reduction (B656/G5).
NEW WALL: the equivariance wall (B650, wall 9 — the classical→stage
functor is GROUP-functorial, never module-linear). NEW LAWS: the
conductor-clock completion (B596 DATA → DERIVED; L84 discharged); the
mirror generic + sector-carry laws; the subfield/shape-field law
candidate; Q-AREA's universal factor 2; the portal law + one-per-block
(B657). DISSOLVED: the 24ζ₆ core ratio (R20-5, basis-gauge). STUCK
LONGEST: R20-1/-2/-3 now carried across two review cycles (from R19); the
13-dial mechanism (since B645). STATUS-VS-EVIDENCE annotation: the
sign-hears-the-discriminant row's THEOREM label rests on the pair-evenness
lemma at ramified primes verified EXHAUSTIVELY (207,384 cases + this
seat's fresh W(D4)/fresh-word battery), not yet abstractly — R21-9 files
the abstract proof as a bounded cell; no other row's status was found to
exceed its banked evidence.

**(4) Error-class recurrence.** E4 (unverified premise): THE window
instance — the C2 design's "unpublished by causality" was FALSE (JUNO's
paper predated the seal by 8 months); cost = the held-out grade
(void-as-held-out; the letter survived); the standing rule that would
have caught it = L99's factual-review lane (registered, awaiting the
owner — R21-10). Related instance: both seats' "~9σ" separation tables
were asserted-not-computed (actual: 0.88σ at 4/13) — corrected in the
B653 addendum. E11 (overextended record): two near-instances caught
pre-commit (64-hex from 8-hex verified prefixes); zero merged. E12
(global-state leakage): RECURRED — test_b353 fails full-suite-in-order,
passes alone and with neighbors; leaker unlocalized (ledger instance
filed 2026-07-17; R21-11). E13 (stale artifact text): minted this window
(B649's "pslq" header + "projective" comment; five dated errata); the
pre-seal narration grep is the standing counter-rule. NO new error class
this window.

**(5) Provenance spot-sweep.** The Review-18 phrase list grepped across
the window's frontier FINDINGS + README + CLAIMS: zero pretense hits
(the only match is README's own §0-style disclaimer). "Independently
verified/confirmed" in B656/B657 reads against §0's definition (a second
internal pipeline) — consistent. TERMINOLOGY: ten of the window's
load-bearing terms were UNGLOSSED (the calibration campaign / one-shot
license; the C′ event; the grammar table / N; the conductor-clock law;
sign-hears-the-discriminant; the sector-carry law; the (i₁,i₂)
reduction; the invariant line; the portal) — glossed in THIS review's PR
(TERMINOLOGY.md, +10 entries).

**(6) The §5.1 promotion sweep.** Every THEOREM/LAW candidate remains
blocked on the single named blocker: the prior-art/novelty pass
(NEEDS-SPECIALIST; carried as R21-7). The candidate list grew this
window: + the melody theorem, sign-hears-the-discriminant, the
conductor-clock law, the portal law, the (i₁,i₂) reduction, the
tone–character identification. Deferral is explicit, per the template.

**(7) Protocol integrity.** Six window seals spot-RE-COMPUTED against
their banked lines, all matching: B648 campaign a463c6aa ✓; C2 design
864909ce ✓; PREDICTION 4392e271 ✓; B654 prereg 299c7a4c ✓; B652 prereg
c8cae450 ✓; B655 prereg fcc8cb8b ✓. Packet seals verified on receipt:
B656 7/7; B657 8/8 (both with disclosed privacy patches + originals'
hashes in manifests). Hash-first order honored through the campaign's
three-way seal choreography (comparator extraction sealed before the
prediction file moved; hashes verified on both ends). The seal ledger
regenerated (#1063). One repaired omission class: none new this window.

**Optional enrichments declared:** view regeneration RAN (seal ledger
#1063; atlas per-arc); terminology repair executed in-place (item 5);
methodology delta = L99 (already registered, not a new arc); source-code
health and reader-path check NOT run this cycle (declared, per the
template's honesty rule).

### Action items (Review 21)
- [x] R21-1: DONE (B666/W31, 2026-07-17) — THE UNCONDITIONAL FORM: B625's 3|κ boundary was a presentation artifact (the level-3κ even-form hypothesis holds for every κ; Gram certificate; 312/312 + 120/120 exact incl. every 3∤κ case; the E₆ aggregate born unconditional)
- [x] R21-2: DONE (B666 cell 9, 2026-07-17) — all six exponents confirm EXACT INTEGERS; the sealed m=11 digits adjudicated as input-precision noise (the B627-era hazard resolved); sign law holds on the exact values
- [x] R21-3: DONE (B666 cell 9, 2026-07-17) — the J-spectrum and per-word branch identifications banked (run-1 failure preserved; run 2 clean)
- [x] R21-4: DONE (B666 cell 8, 2026-07-17) — θ₂₇∘conj built exactly; h¹(D_conjθ) = 5; THE GLUED CUBIC NONDEGENERATE (rank 5, kernel 0, both conventions); L92 closed with it
- [x] R21-5: SHARPENED (B666/cell7, 2026-07-17) — THE FIRST-POWER LAW (v_P(lit-dev) = 1 at every prime over the dial, 8/8 both objects); the norm-mechanism refuted as uniform; v13 localizes on the class-4 pairs (two independent witnesses); the DIRECTIONAL split-prime discovery ((1,0) at the primes over 13 on the silver — an invariant asymmetry); the residual mechanism question carries in the campaign's out-list
- [x] R21-6: DONE (owner-directed 2026-07-17; B658, prereg 0c4a1115) — both order-4 families BROKEN with the same singular d = (0,0,1); wall 8 upgraded to the TOTAL statement (all four orientation-reversing families of D₄ break; the double's symmetry = σ* exactly)
- [>] R21-7: CARRIED to R22-1 (the sweep phase done in B659; the specialist bar remains; the queue grew with the RR identities)
- [>] R21-8: CARRIED to R22-2 (the seal never landed)
- [x] R21-9: PROVEN (B666 cell 4, 2026-07-17) — elementary and UNCONDITIONAL: each pair product f(ζ)f(ζ̄) = (t−ζ−ζ̄)² is a literal square; det B_w = (t−2)^{a₁}(t+2)^{a₂}Λ², Λ ∈ ℤ; no ramified case split exists; both directions + the exactly-half law now abstract theorems on even-rank lattices (hypothesis weakened to finite-order GL_n(ℤ))
- [x] R21-10: DONE (2026-07-17) — owner approved; GOVERNANCE §16 adopted (adversarial factual review of instantiated designs; live-verification stamps; widened anomaly clause; the subagent-reviewer provision with the blinded-lane carve-out) + WORKING_RULES rule 13; L99 closed
- [x] R21-11: LOCALIZED + REPAIRED (B666 cell 5, 2026-07-17) — collection-time module import (the last module-level dps in sorted order wins); per-test fixture repair adopted; the E-ledger's false inference corrected; the 12-file sweep priced

anchor-commit: `4d02afe` (Review 21; #1065)

## REVIEW 22 — EXECUTED 2026-07-18 (the second constitutional review; window #1066–#1093, B658–B674-open)

**The loop (item 1):** the R21 block fully dispositioned — R21-1/-2/-3/-4/-5/-6/-9/-10/-11 resolved with evidence pointers
(the B658 order-4 wall; §16; the B666 campaign cells; B671's extraction);
R21-7 carried (the sweep phase done in B659 + the RR quintic identities
now ADDED to the specialist queue; the bar itself remains the program's
one external dependency) and R21-8 carried (the web seat's L95 prereg,
never landed). The review-actions gate reads the superseded block clean.

**The declared modulus (item 2):** 28 first-parent merges (#1066–#1093),
B658–B673 read in full plus the B666/B662 campaign synthesis documents;
the fast suite re-run TWICE this window (the second run surfacing and
repairing three failures — see item 4); OA_SLOW not re-run; the standing
pilot caveat holds (author = reviewer; the counterweight is the two-seat
receipt loop, which this window exercised at its historical maximum:
SEVEN independent convergences — the sum rule two-seat, the slot
structure two-pipeline, Track H two-adjudication, Massey-zero two-seat,
the F4 skeleton two-seat, the ceiling tables armed, the landscape
two-route — and SIX reciprocal corrections across seats).

**(3) Advancement — the record's largest window.** GOVERNANCE §16
adopted. Walls: 8-total (B658), 10-as-theorem + the silence note
(cell S), the Massey wall, the fifth wall, and the gauge verdict
(B671). THEOREM upgrades: the dimension grammar (family-wide), the
subfield law, sign-hears-the-discriminant (unconditional), LAW-O
complete, the Latin square, the unconditional reciprocity, the
landscape/shadow-class/stage-universal chain, the exact minimal period
175560, the branch-tiebreak dichotomy. DISCOVERIES: hearing =
character theory of shadows; the metallic-McKay descent E8→E7→E6
complete (mode = SL(2)-realizability; the partner at the
ring-conductor prime); the F4 skeleton; Q-C = c; the Galois pair
{SU(3)₂, SU(5)₁}; the generation sum rule (two-seat); the slot
saturation with the graded sign rule; THE ROGERS–RAMANUJAN
RECOGNITION (the doublet ratio = R(q)); the 13-localization +
first-power law + the directional split. L91 reduced to two named
principles (H-EAR + H-CUSP, all instances computed). CLOSED LEADS
this window: L92, L96, L97, L100–L108 (all of the campaign's targets)
— the frontier's live set is now: H-EAR, H-CUSP, the generation leg
(two routes running), the scalarization-gauge follow-on, the
directional-13 mechanism, and the seats' loop-5 lanes. STUCK LONGEST:
the specialist bar (R21-7, two reviews).

**(4) Error-class recurrence.** E14 MINTED (B480's noise-band value —
corrected with a dated FINDINGS edit). E12's mechanism REPLACED
(collection-time import; the false "collects-after" inference
withdrawn; TWO instances repaired (b353, b357); the 12-file
module-level-dps sweep remains priced). The public-surface scan caught
a seat-label leak introduced by THIS seat's own ledger edits (fixed
same-day) — the scanner works on its author. OPERATIONAL PATTERN
NAMED (no banked corruption, caught each time): chained shell
commands crossing `cd` boundaries misplaced ledger appends four times
this window — the adopted counter-rule is worktree-isolated banking +
root-anchored ledger edits, now standard practice. cc2-side hygiene:
POST-SEAL PREREG DRIFT observed twice (loop-2/loop-4 preregs) —
flagged in both packet manifests; their answer is an R22 item.

**(5) Provenance spot-sweep.** The pretense grep: clean (the one hit
was the deliberate README disclaimer). The seat-label scan: the one
leak found and fixed in-window (above). New load-bearing terms
glossed with their arcs (the shadow-class law, the F4 skeleton, the
ceiling law, H-EAR/H-CUSP live in their FINDINGS pending the next
TERMINOLOGY pass — R22 item).

**(6) The §5.1 promotion sweep.** Everything remains behind the
specialist bar; the queue GREW: + the RR quintic identities (B672,
explicitly needs-specialist), the stage-universal character law, the
McKay-descent triple, the unconditional sign theorem. The dossier
(B659) plus this window's additions is the hand-over package.

**(7) Protocol integrity.** Spot-recomputed this review: the B666
prereg 84e7245f + ADDENDUM_1 with its two sealed amendments
(c8461cf3, 82d5cd62 — the F′ re-scope trail intact); B669's
d5f025bf with its failing-then-passing control preserved; the B673
manifest's seal disposition (5/25 raw resolved as delta-vs-cumulative
+ the two flagged drifts). Hash-first held throughout; the
tracked-forbidden gate blocked one add-sweep in-window (the gate
working on the governor).

### Action items (Review 22)
- [>] R22-1: the specialist pass — ADVANCED (the summit dossier assembled, PR #1144); the external read carried as R23-1
- [>] R22-2: the web seat's L95 prereg — verify-on-receipt; never landed, carried as R23-2
- [x] R22-3: VERIFIED + CLOSED (B677, 2026-07-18) — sealed-addendum chains, no breach (the chain hashes match this seat's own banked as-received manifests); the re-seal protocol adopted program-wide
- [x] R22-4: DONE (B676, 2026-07-18) — the sweep grew to 18 import-wraps + per-file pinned fixtures (the b204 pattern) + a conftest collection-finish guard; two MASKED leakers (b246, b250) unmasked and repaired; one B671 absolute-path straggler fixed en route; full suite 2428 passed / 0 failed
- [x] R22-5: DONE (2026-07-18) — eight terms glossed + the golden-rotation LAW_MAP row
- [x] R22-6: RESOLVED — the generation leg landed and CLOSED (B685 KILLED-AT-SUPPORT → terminal no-go; one-shot spent at the support pre-test, K020 control never triggered — no hit; #1128)
- [>] R22-7: H-CUSP RESOLVED (predictive principle 3/3, B675); H-EAR reframed by B685 (the hearing is coupling) — carried as R23-3

## REVIEW 23 — EXECUTED 2026-07-18 (the third constitutional review; window #1095–#1145, B674–B697 + the summit dossier + VERIFY-M)

**The loop (item 1):** the R22 block fully dispositioned.
- **R22-1** (the specialist pass / dossier): ADVANCED — the hand-over
  package was BUILT this window (Track C: `docs/dossiers/
  DOSSIER_the_arithmetic_object_2026-07-18.md`, the summit-current
  physics-free statement + the five named specialist gates + cc2's §3
  bifocal anatomy). The external read itself remains the program's one
  external dependency → carried as **R23-1**.
- **R22-2** (the web seat's L95 prereg verify-on-receipt): never landed
  → carried as **R23-2**.
- **R22-6** (the generation-leg adjudication on landing): RESOLVED — the
  leg LANDED and CLOSED this window. B685 KILLED-AT-SUPPORT → terminal
  no-go theorem; the design cell STOPPED at the support pre-test (the
  two-route disagreement caught a deeper question), so the one-shot was
  spent honestly and never fired against the RR targets. The cc3 leg of
  the sealed plan (353ca003) was not invoked — the leg closed at support
  before any design shot, so the two-seat + chat1 gate carried it; the
  K020 silver control never triggered (no hit to control). `[x]`
- **R22-7** (H-EAR / H-CUSP endgame): H-CUSP is now a **banked predictive
  principle, 3/3 objects** (B672/B675 — golden/silver/bronze) → that half
  resolved. H-EAR's "L91 endgame" was reframed by B685: the hearing is
  COUPLING, not generated, so the endgame is the observer-coupling closure
  rather than a generation proof. The formal principle-status of H-EAR
  carries → **R23-3**.
- R22-3/-4/-5 remain `[x]` (banked B677/B676/2026-07-18).

**The declared modulus (item 2):** 51 first-parent merges (#1095–#1145),
B674–B697 read in full (the banking seat authored the majority this
session, so recall is direct, not sampled). Gates re-run 8/8 twice this
review; the full pytest suite (2428 locks) NOT re-run this review —
trusted-green from B676's in-window 2428/0 baseline + the incremental
per-arc locks (test_b685…test_b697, all added green); OA_SLOW not run.
The standing pilot caveat holds (author = reviewer); the counterweight —
the two/three-seat receipt loop — ran at the program's historical maximum
this window: the generation-leg two-route design gate, the **VERIFY-M
triple-gate** (origin + cc2 replication + cc machine) on both no-go
pillars, the Frobenius two-seat convergence (cc/cc2 on chat1's claim), the
conductor-15 two-model isogeny match, and TWO reciprocal cross-seat
corrections owned in-window (E16 cc2→cc chirality; the §3 melody-period
cc→cc2). This review can certify: the arcs' internal math + locks + the
firewall discipline. It cannot certify: external novelty (R23-1) or the
untouched slow suite.

**(3) Advancement — the record's MOST CONSEQUENTIAL window.** The
program's central ambition reached a proven terminal statement. Headline:
**the generation leg closed as a terminal no-go (B685) — the object
generates its being, not its hearing — realizing the observer-coupling
thesis for a concrete structure, with its arithmetic root proven
(B691, the totient asymmetry) and its mechanism named two-seat (B697,
Frobenius gluing at inert 5).** The entire being face was mapped (the
Eisenstein campaign E-1..E-4, B689–B696 + the EISENSTEIN_ATLAS), mirroring
the golden ATLAS v2. New THEOREM/LAW rows: the golden-rotation law (B674,
THEOREM-grade); the figure-eight's curve = 15a8 / conductor 15 (B674,
THEOREM-grade + isogeny confirmed two-model); the divided-power law
(B683, THEOREM, proved unconditional all-n + all-prime corollary);
volume = being-character L-value (B680, LAW, exact); Mahler = being volume
≠ elliptic K₂ (B683/L3, LAW + bounding negative); deaf = non-CM (B675,
candidate THEOREM, 3 legs); the silver octic in the silver ratio (S1/T6,
THEOREM two-seat); H-CUSP + the quantization-index=conductor law (B675,
predictive principle 3/3); the sum-rule = theorem of the cubic (B684/G1);
the own-channel level-2 law (B684/G2); the D4 value catalogue closed +
golden period 20 (B684/G3); the totient root (B691); the level-15
handshake (B695); the 5-adic exclusion / W2 Molien kill #8 + the
exponentiation design theorem (W2). STUCK-LONGEST (unchanged): the
external specialist bar — unmovable internally by construction (R21-7 →
R22-1 → R23-1). OVERREACH: two caught and corrected IN-window (E15 the
{3,5} misread → B685; E16 the chirality over-read → B695, S067 row 3
falsified); cc2's independent §6 status pass over 36
hearing/chord LAW_MAP rows (28 KEEP / 8 DOWNGRADE) LANDED and was
verified-on-receipt (all 8 source citations confirmed this seat) and
APPLIED: H1 shadow-class 'for ANY word'→CONJECTURE, H5 twist-tone→
CERTIFIED, H8 K020-in-ear→PLACEMENT (the clearest — B642's own 'still a
placement, not a derivation'), H11 jump-law→CERTIFIED+sketch, H13
PSL-factoring→CERTIFIED(k≤8), C3 swap-real→LAW, C7 F4-skeleton scoped to
the two banked holonomies, C8 cubic-dichotomy split. META (reassuring):
the primary sources are honestly written; the 8 overclaims were in
LAW_MAP's one-line compression — editorial, NOT integrity.

**(4) Error-class recurrence.** All three window self-corrections are
ledgered (ERROR_LEDGER E15 line 27, E16 line 29, E12 line 22). The
RECURRING class this window is **"over-reading a generic feature as
special"** (the base-rate / numerology family): E15 (the {3,5} source
misread, manufacturing a spurious hearing-prime out of powers of 3) and
E16 (opposite Atkin-Lehner signs — a generic even-rank fact, verified
14a/26a/57a — read as emergent chirality) are both this class. E12 is a
re-hardening of the pre-existing global-state (dps) class, not a reasoning
recurrence. NO new class lacks an entry. The standing rule that catches
E16 — COMMS_PROTOCOL §4's MANDATORY base-rate + convention gate ("is this
feature generic across the family?" surfaces AL-signs ⟺ even-rank before
banking) — was ADDED this window (COMMS v1.1), partly in response to E16,
closing the loop. That the record's most physics-facing window produced
exactly ONE reasoning-error class, both instances caught and corrected
two-seat in-window, is the discipline holding at its hardest test.

**(5) The provenance spot-sweep.** CLEAN on both load-bearing checks.
External-verification pretense: ZERO hits across the six public dossier/
atlas/speculation files + 21 in-window FINDINGS — every "independent /
independently / confirmed" is internal (cc / cc2 / main-seat, per COMMS
v1.1), and the one external fetch (cc2's arXiv e-print pull for VERIFY-M)
checks *against* the literature, not claiming its endorsement. The summit
dossier is explicitly honest — "internally verified (two seats + machine
locks)", the specialist read named as "the program's ONE external
dependency", still unfulfilled. Papers: no PAPER.md touched in-window; the
portfolio's status labels hold (PC22 needs-specialist, P4 patches-pending,
Tier 3 "do NOT dress these as contributions"). ONE gap (action, not a
failure): the eight load-bearing window terms — Frobenius gluing,
divided-power law, totient root, being/hearing face, the two hands,
conductor-15, deaf=non-CM — lack dedicated TERMINOLOGY glosses (adjacent
coverage exists); (TERMINOLOGY.md is at repo root — the sweep's path assumption, not a
template bug; the template references it correctly). → R23-5.

**(6) The §5.1 promotion sweep.** Everything stays behind the specialist
bar; Gate 5 held with ZERO physics promotions despite the window turning
toward the physics-facing side. Three physics-adjacent claims were
FIREWALLED with their kills this window: the Koide claim (B686 — Q=2/3 is
a 120° parametrization tautology; θ₀=2/9 convention-dependent + base-rate);
the SM atlas (B687 — 1 live sealed-question candidate, explicitly NOT
evidence); chat1's surgery chain (B688 — math-sound, SM-firewalled). The
specialist queue GREW with the summit: the observer-coupling closure
(B685), the totient root (B691), conductor-15 novelty vs Borot–Eynard
(B674/B692), the Frobenius mechanism (B697). The summit dossier IS the
processed hand-over package (its §7 lists the five gates). Nothing
promoted to CLAIMS beyond the proven core.

**(7) Protocol integrity.** The three whole-file prereg seals of the
generation leg all recompute MATCH against their banked lines: PREREG_W2
(b4c9a6bb, SEAL_LEDGER:148), PREREG_W3_DECISION (563a2858, :150),
PREREG_W3_RUN (83c50a35, :157). Hash-first order HONORED — each seal
commit strictly precedes its result-banking commits (W2 #1104 < #1105–07;
W3_DECISION #1108 < #1109–10; W3_RUN #1126 < the support-STOP #1127 <
B685 #1128), and each shows a single post-seal commit (never edited).
Cross-seat as-received hashes also verify (W2 close-outs 57a1ddca,
489aea17). TWO bookkeeping gaps (NOT integrity breaches): (a) the VERIFY-M
prereg (146da991) is a cc2-seat file whose hash + results traveled to main
but whose body is not banked here — expected for cross-seat, worth a
cross-reference; (b) ADDENDUM_1's own sha8 (f99e8b59) is recorded nowhere
though SEAL_LEDGER points to ARTIFACT_HASHES. → R23-6.

### Action items (Review 23)
- [>] R23-1: the specialist pass — the summit dossier is now the assembled hand-over package; the external read remains the program's one external dependency (carried from R22-1; source: PR #1144)
- [>] R23-2: the web seat's L95 prereg — verify-on-receipt (carried from R22-2; never landed)
- [>] R23-3: H-EAR's principle-status — reframed by B685 (the hearing is coupling); the formal statement carries (from R22-7; H-CUSP resolved 3/3 at B675)
- [x] R23-4: DONE (2026-07-18) — cc2's §6 status pass (28 keep / 8 downgrade) verified-on-receipt (8/8 citations) and APPLIED to LAW_MAP; full inventory at docs/dossiers/S6_theorem_inventory_cc2.md
- [x] R23-5: DONE (2026-07-18) — the 8 summit-term glosses added to TERMINOLOGY.md (Frobenius gluing, divided-power law, totient root, being/hearing face, the two hands, conductor-15, deaf=non-CM); the template path was already correct (no bug)
- [x] R23-6: DONE (2026-07-18) — ADDENDUM_1's hash f99e8b59 recorded in its SEAL_LEDGER row; VERIFY-M (146da991) cross-referenced as a cc2-seat prereg. (Note: an accidental seal_ledger.py regen was caught and reverted — the descriptive cross-check hashes preserved.)

## REVIEW 24 — EXECUTED 2026-07-19 (the fourth constitutional review; window #1147–#1166, B698–B706 + the fiber-functor program + the seam + the Listening Protocol)

**The loop (item 1):** the R23 block fully dispositioned.
- **R23-1** (the specialist pass): ADVANCED — the assembled package grew from
  the summit dossier to the dossier + the **Listening Protocol** (the
  constructive-firewall methodology) + the fiber-functor program's K020-in-ear
  upgrade. The external read remains the program's one external dependency →
  carried as **R24-1**.
- **R23-2** (the web seat's L95 prereg): never landed → carried as **R24-2**.
- **R23-3** (H-EAR's principle-status): SUBSUMED this window — B700–B706 fully
  structured the hearing (the fiber-functor torsor + the audibility law +
  three-way golden uniqueness); "the hearing is the coupling" (B685) is now the
  fiber-functor theorem (B701). H-EAR as a separate open principle is absorbed
  into the fiber-functor program; the residual formal statement carries →
  **R24-3**.
- R23-4/-5/-6 remain `[x]` (done 2026-07-18).

**The declared modulus (item 2):** 23 first-parent merges (#1147–#1166), arcs
B698–B706 + the fiber-functor program (B700/B701) + S068/S069 + the Listening
Protocol — read in full (the banking seat authored the majority this session;
recall is direct). Gates 8/8 throughout (framing/Gate-5 the load-bearing one
this window and clean); ~10 new per-arc locks added (test_b698…test_b706, all
green); the full pytest suite NOT re-run this review (trusted-green + the
incremental locks); OA_SLOW not run. This is the record's most PHYSICS-FACING
window (the SM-values / rung-2 door) and its most CONCEPTUAL. The pilot caveat
(author=reviewer) holds; the counterweight — the two/three-seat receipt loop —
ran at maximum: the VERIFY-M triple-gate, the §6 QA, B698 Frobenius two-seat,
B699 two-object gate, **B701 phase-2 (my solo OBSTRUCTED CONTESTED by cc2's
cleaner U-anchoring, then CONVERGED on the same verdict — the strongest form of
the gate this program has run)**, B702's E17 (cc2 self-caught), B706 rung-2
(cc2 confirmed + refined). Reciprocal corrections both directions: cc2 caught my
B702 framing (E17) and my B706 Cabibbo wording; I caught chat1's Fact 4/5 errors
and the Turok hook.

**(3) Advancement — the record's most CONCEPTUAL + most physics-facing window,
with ZERO physics promotions.** The headline is a meta-law upgrade:
**B701 turned the observer-coupling thesis into a THEOREM** — measurement = a
fiber-functor Galois torsor (B700, stage-uniform, three-sided; K020-in-ear
PLACEMENT → theorem-grade torsor structure), provably NON-canonical, with the
obstruction REQUIRED by B685. **B704** unified B698/B699 (the genus ℤ/2), cell 2
(V₄), B700/B701 (torsors), B702 (audibility) into ONE 𝔽₂-vector space (the
seam, no canonical origin). **B706** ran the deepest door (the rung-2 structural
comparator) → **NO-MATCH** (wall 11): the SM flavor is generic over the audible
field, and its freedom is CONTINUOUS where the object's is DISCRETE — a
different KIND of arbitrariness; the object ends at the discrete, the continuous
begins with the coupling. New LAW/PLACEMENT rows: the meeting-is-a-product +
ℤ/2 (B698); hearing-is-a-bundle-phenomenon (B699); measurement=fiber-functor
(B700); the seam 𝔽₂-space (B704); the metallic-hearing/audibility law (B702,
corrected); the golden three-way uniqueness (B705). **A new STANDING GATE**: the
Listening Protocol (governance-level; the firewall made constructive). STUCK-
LONGEST (unchanged): the external specialist bar. OVERREACH caught + corrected
IN-window: E17 (the B702 swap-law conflated swap/weld — cc2 self-caught); my
B701 solo verdict was premature (cc2 contested, converged); my B706 Cabibbo
"base-rate-weak" mis-wording (cc2: it's field-mismatch, corrected); the Turok
CPT resonance (refuted in S068 before it could become a hook); θ₀ over-read
(chat1's 7σ → 0.89σ, kept firewalled). cc2's §6 downgrade discipline continued
to bite. [cc2 §6-style overreach re-check: none new banked as a LAW this window.]

**(4) Error-class recurrence.** **E17** (the B702 swap/weld conflation — "a
hearing/tone claim must name swap-vs-weld + field real/imaginary type BEFORE the
law") is recorded (ERROR_LEDGER:31) — the window's genuinely NEW class,
"conflation / naming without field-type," cc2 self-caught. The RECURRING class
is "over-reading a generic feature as special" (E15/E16): the B706 Cabibbo 9/40
trap is an instance (a generic close rational read as a golden "candidate") —
but its own standing rule (compute the discriminating fact; check base-rate AND
field) is EXACTLY what caught it (field-mismatch: 9/40 ∈ ℚ, not the audible
ℚ(√5); no √5). **The rule WORKING, not failing** — strengthening E16. The other
self-corrections are external catches, correctly ledgered where they belong:
B703's Koide "~7σ → 0.89σ" (chat1's figure, in HINT_LEDGER H-KOIDE + firewalled,
no own-error); the Turok-hook refutation (S068, external literature hope,
honestly refuted). No own-error went unledgered; no new class lacks an entry.

**(5) The provenance spot-sweep.** CLEAN on both load-bearing checks — and
this was the window where it mattered most (heavy firewalled speculation citing
Turok, Connes, Majid, Witten, Grothendieck). **External-verification pretense:
none.** Every "verification/confirm/vindicated" is either a legitimate citation
or an explicitly-internal seat cross-check; the famous-scientist citations
carry NO endorsement pretense — S068 REFUTES the Turok resonance ("citing it =
numerology in physics dress"), rates the others SUPERFICIAL/PARTIAL, marks
Witten/CLPW/Connes as "[LEAP, honest gap] — do not overstate," and includes an
Eddington retrofitting WARNING. **Firewall/Gate-5 integrity:** clean — S068,
S069, and the Listening Protocol all carry firewall language and assert no SM
value as derived; the one value-shaped token (Q=2/3 in the protocol) is
explicitly firewalled as a non-result. Gate 5 held under the program's maximum
physics-facing pressure. ONE gap (action, not failure): the six load-bearing
window terms — "the seam," "measurement = fiber functor," "the audibility law,"
"the Listening Protocol," "the structural comparator," "rung-1/rung-2" — are
not yet in TERMINOLOGY.md. → R24-4.

**(6) The §5.1 promotion sweep.** ZERO physics promotions — under the maximum
physics-facing pressure of the whole program (the SM-values question, the
rung-2 door). Every physics-adjacent quantity firewalled with its verdict:
θ₀=2/9 (0.89σ, HINT-grade, B703); the Cabibbo 9/40 trap (field-mismatch, dead,
B706); Q5's 7983360 (base-rate-dead); the Turok/CPT resonance (REFUTED, S068).
The Listening Protocol makes the firewall CONSTRUCTIVE (rungs 1–3 = the object
speaking, rungs 4–5 = numerology) — a genuine methodological advance, not a
promotion. The specialist queue is the dossier + the Listening Protocol + the
fiber-functor upgrade + B706. Nothing to CLAIMS.

**(7) Protocol integrity.** All SEVEN whole-file preregs this window recompute
MATCH against their SEAL_LEDGER lines: B698 (1e51ae30), B700 cells 1/2/4/5
(1bbdb15b / 060aaaee / 7323661c / c8292c34), B701 phase-2 (0eb5026b), B706
(3af39f7f) — banked file = sealed file, no post-seal edit. **Hash-first:
honest-pass with a PROVENANCE CAVEAT** — the squash-merge workflow co-lands each
arc's PREREG and FINDINGS in ONE commit (B698 #1150, B706 #1166), so git linear
history does NOT separate the seal-commit from the verdict-commit. Hash-first is
evidenced instead by (a) the whole-file-hash-match (the sealed file was never
edited after banking) + (b) the dated "sealed BEFORE the verdict" SEAL_LEDGER
note — consistent with hash-first, but not independently provable from commit
order alone. This is a real, standing feature of the squash-merge process (not a
breach) → R24-5.

### Action items (Review 24)
- [>] R24-1: the specialist pass — the package is now the dossier + the Listening Protocol + the fiber-functor program (K020-in-ear upgrade); the external read remains the one external dependency (carried from R23-1)
- [>] R24-2: the web seat's L95 prereg — verify-on-receipt (never landed; carried from R23-2)
- [>] R24-3: H-EAR's residual formal statement — subsumed by the fiber-functor program (B700–B706); carry the formal note (from R23-3)
- [x] R24-4: DONE (2026-07-19) — the six window-term glosses added to TERMINOLOGY.md — the seam, measurement=fiber-functor, the audibility law, the Listening Protocol, the structural comparator, rung-1/rung-2 (owner: cc; source: this review's provenance sweep)
- [x] R24-5: RESOLVED (2026-07-20, B710–B719) — every arc this window committed its sealed PREREG in a SEPARATE PR before the findings PR (git-provable hash-first); standing practice adopted. [was:] hash-first provenance — the squash-merge workflow co-lands PREREG+FINDINGS in one commit, so seal-before-verdict is not git-provable per arc (whole-file-hash-match carries it). For the SEALED-SHOT / firewalled class (one-shot design cells), commit the sealed PREREG in a SEPARATE commit before the FINDINGS (as the generation-leg design cell did) so hash-first is git-provable (owner: cc; source: this review's protocol-integrity check)

## REVIEW 25 — EXECUTED 2026-07-20 (the fifth constitutional review; window B707–B719 — the "physics of the object" clarification + the meeting-point + the child)

**(1) The loop — R24 fully dispositioned.**
- **R24-1** (the specialist pass): carried → **R25-1**. The package GREW enormously
  this window — the summit dossier + the Listening Protocol + the fiber-functor program
  is now + the **complete physics-of-the-object clarification** (the 4 frontiers B713–B716,
  the capstone B717, the child B718, the scale probe B719) + the meeting-point (B707/B708,
  arithmetic Chern–Simons / Kim). The external read remains the one external dependency.
- **R24-2** (the web seat's L95 prereg): still never landed → carried **R25-2**.
- **R24-3** (H-EAR's residual formal statement): subsumed by the fiber-functor program and
  now the whole clarification → carried **R25-3**.
- **R24-4**: `[x]` done (TERMINOLOGY glosses, 2026-07-19).
- **R24-5** (hash-first git-provable for the sealed-shot class): **`[x]` RESOLVED this
  window.** The ENTIRE B710–B719 campaign committed each sealed PREREG in a SEPARATE PR
  BEFORE its findings PR (B710–712 #1172→#1173; B713 #1174→#1175; B714 #1176→#1177; B715
  #1178→#1179; B716 #1180→#1181; B718 #1183→#1184; B719 #1185→#1186) — hash-first is now
  git-provable per arc, exactly as R24-5 asked. Standing practice adopted.

**(2) The declared modulus.** ~21 first-parent merges since R24 (anchor 2e278b5),
arcs B707–B719 + the two-seat convergences (cc2's triality-matter, Structural Unfolding
Atlas, child-integration — each verified-on-receipt). This window is the program's MOST
conceptually ambitious and MOST physics-facing: the observer-coupling thesis completed
as a full physics-of-the-object account. The banking seat authored the majority; recall
direct. **NEW modality this window: the multiagent WORKFLOW** (compute→3-skeptic
adversarial-verify→refine loops) became the primary discovery instrument (~8 campaigns,
~150 agents). ~40 new per-arc locks (test_b707…test_b719, all green); full pytest NOT
re-run each arc (trusted-green + incremental locks); OA_SLOW not run. Gates 8/8
throughout (framing/Gate-5 the load-bearing one, clean). Also the window with the most
INFRASTRUCTURE degradation (B719: 4 API stream-timeouts) — a harness failure mode, not
a science one; handled by in-seat clean re-runs.

**(3) Advancement — the most conceptual window, ZERO physics promotions.** No row
crossed into THEOREM/LAW toward physics; nothing to CLAIMS. The headline is the
**completion of the observer-coupling thesis as a physics-of-the-object clarification**:
the object is timeless/vector-like/valueless/incomplete BEING (B713–B717), and chirality
(B713), values (B685/B706/B714), time/4d/Lorentzian (B716), the spatial manifold (the
child B718), and MULTIPLICITY/scale (B719) are ALL the observer's closings. New PLACEMENT
rows: the meeting-point = arithmetic CS (B707/B708); the Turok INVERSION + the analytic-T1
thimble inversion + the two-ℤ/2 V₄ (B709–B711); chirality-is-the-observer's (B713); the
physics-of-the-object spine (B714); native gauge = complex CS not Yang–Mills (B715); time
is the observer's (B716); the observer-emergence spine (B717); the child ledger — reality
is arithmetically generic, authors no skeleton (B718); multiplicity=scale=the observer's
(B719). Two motifs banked: object supplies boundaries / observer supplies closings; and
c-as-SWAP (verified across B710/711/712/713 + the T7 split primes). STUCK-LONGEST
(unchanged): the external specialist bar. **OVERREACH caught + corrected IN-window (the
adversarial machinery working):** the ℤ/5=hearing over-read (cc2's completeness critic
caught it; I conceded + verified b₁=0); the h=3=INHERITED over-read (owner's push found
the real 4/4 pattern, the control resolved it GENERIC — corrected); B715-T7's
orientation-inverts-ℤ/11 premise (skeptic refuted → banked INCONCLUSIVE, not B); B719
probe-2's "d=6 homologically forced" (S₆⊃A₅) + "unbounded" (skeptic caught → corrected);
the loose ℚ(√−283)→S₄ quartic x⁴−x−1 (probe 3). No row's status exceeds its evidence.

**(4) Error-class recurrence.** The RECURRING class "over-reading a generic/small feature
as special" (E15/E16 family) recurred TWICE and was CAUGHT both times: (a) ℤ/5=hearing
(integer-5 vs field-ℚ(√5) conflation — the exact E15 exponent-vs-base shape); (b)
h=3=inherited (a real pattern read as causal — caught by the base-rate + control, exactly
the standing rule). The rule WORKING, not failing. **NEW class E18** (ERROR_LEDGER:34):
"workflow-artifact provenance under degradation" — a degraded campaign left a compute
agent's _out.txt with verdict text its committed script did not generate, and silently
failed the h=3 control; standing rule = the banking seat re-runs load-bearing computations
clean in-seat before sealing, and carries a probe that did not run as OPEN, never inferred.

**(5) The provenance spot-sweep.** CLEAN on both load-bearing checks under the program's
MAXIMUM physics-facing pressure. **External-verification pretense: none** — every physics
statement is explicitly STRUCTURAL ("which manifold/time/handedness/number/count is the
observer's," never a value derived); the famous-name citations (Witten, Kim, Connes,
Turok, Thurston, Mostow, Maclachlan–Reid, Baker–Heegner–Stark) carry no endorsement
pretense. **Firewall/Gate-5 integrity: clean** — the entire clarification asserts no SM
value as derived; the B719 provenance breach (an auto-generated _out.txt ≠ its script) was
skeptic-caught and repaired (clean in-seat re-run) → the source of E18. Gate 5 held under
the whole "physics of the object." New load-bearing terms not yet in TERMINOLOGY: "the
incompleteness / the closing," "c-as-swap," "the child," "being-only," "native gauge =
complex Chern–Simons," "multiplicity = the covering degree." → R25-4.

**(6) The §5.1 promotion sweep.** ZERO physics promotions under the maximum conceptual
pressure of the program. The one candidate for a positive — the h=3 being-filter (a real
non-base-rate 4/4 pattern the owner's push surfaced) — was correctly NOT promoted: the
control resolved it GENERIC (a small-numbers effect + the cubic⟺3|h residue, present for
any Bianchi parent), not the object's fingerprint. Every physics-adjacent quantity stays
firewalled with its verdict. Nothing to CLAIMS.

**(7) Protocol integrity.** Hash-first HONORED and IMPROVED (R24-5 resolved — separate
prereg PRs per arc, git-provable). Sealed-hash spot-check: B709 93879b9d, B713 5e583a40,
B716 e01a8451, B719 165fb4b2 all recompute-MATCH their banked SEAL_LEDGER lines (sealed
pre-verdict). One honest caveat: B719 was API-degraded (probe 1 the h=3 control did not
run in the campaign; re-run as a single focused agent + verified-on-receipt, then banked
as resolved-B); the degradation and the re-run are disclosed in B719's FINDINGS.

### Action items (Review 25)
- [>] R25-1: the specialist pass — the package is now the full physics-of-the-object clarification (B713–B717) + the child (B718) + the scale probe (B719) + the meeting-point (B707/B708 arithmetic CS); the external read remains the one external dependency (carried from R24-1)
- [>] R25-2: the web seat's L95 prereg — verify-on-receipt (never landed; carried from R24-2)
- [>] R25-3: H-EAR's residual formal statement — subsumed by the fiber-functor program + the full clarification; carry the formal note (from R24-3)
- [x] R25-4: DONE (Review 26) — the window's glosses added to TERMINOLOGY.md (the incompleteness/the closing, c-as-swap, the child, being-only, native-gauge=complex-Chern–Simons, multiplicity=covering-degree, + the Born ledger)
- [x] R25-5: DONE (adopted standing) — E18 enacted as a pre-seal step throughout B720–B729: the banking seat re-runs load-bearing computations clean in-seat before sealing (e.g. B728's C₄≠C₂×C₂ crux verified in-sandbox before banking cc2's run; B724 compute-not-cite; every cross-seat claim verified). No degradation-provenance breach this window.

anchor-commit: `3e5d56b` (Review 25)

## REVIEW 26 — EXECUTED 2026-07-20 (THE HONEST CLOSING — the SM-bridge hope closed by the program's own base-rate discipline; window #1189–#1211, B720–B729)

**(1) The scope.** 24 first-parent merges since Review 25 (anchor `3e5d56b`),
arcs **B720–B729** + S070 (creation-narrative resonance sweep, firewalled) +
the B722 two-seat reconcile + the B707 Galakhov–Morozov citation reinstatement.
The banking seat (cc) authored the majority; cc2 ran ~5 independent campaigns
(the observer build, the seeing-strategy adjudication, the Born-rule axiomatic
run, the odds-measurement, the Stokes resummation), each verified-on-receipt.
This is the window in which **the specific hope that the object encodes the
Standard Model was HONESTLY CLOSED** — not by fiat but by the program turning
its own base-rate discipline onto its flagship structural claim.

**(2) The declared modulus.** Three movements. (a) **The coupling-path
exhaustion + the observer BUILT** (B720–B723): the discrete→continuous bridge
belongs to the object's own arithmetic or nothing (B720); the two arithmetic
leads (thermal-time/CMR, resurgence/Kashaev) are field-matched but rung-
mismatched (B721/B722); the observer is CONSTRUCTED as the β=1 spontaneous
symmetry breaking of the arithmetic thermal system — measurement = cooling
through the critical point (B723). (b) **The Born-content ledger fully mapped**
(B725–B726, B728–B729): the Born rule's arithmetic is stratified — FORM
(ℚ(√−3)) + WEIGHTS (ℚ(√5)) are the object's two QUADRATIC fields (classical
content, forced-native); AMPLITUDES (ℚ(√(2+φ))) + PHASE (ℚ(ζ₅)) + associator
(ℚ(√φ)) are QUARTIC golden-MTC OVERLAYS (quantum content), ramified away from
the object's prime 3. The object supplies the probabilities, not the
amplitudes. (c) **THE SELF-AUDIT** (B727 + B724): the base-rate/look-elsewhere
discipline that killed NUMBER-matching (B724 chat-1 re-audit, correcting E19)
was at last turned on the flagship STRUCTURAL claim (E₆-across-three-faces) —
and it came back GENERIC, two seats independently (B727 + cc2's odds). **New
modality matured this window: the TWO-SEAT INDEPENDENT-RUN** — cc and cc2
running the same door from opposite angles (SSB-dynamics vs axiomatic; base-
rate vs odds; the Stokes resummation) and CONVERGING — decisive in
B725/B727/B728. ~30 new per-arc locks (test_b720…test_b729, all green); gates
8/8 throughout.

**(3) Advancement — the honest NEGATIVE is the headline; ZERO physics
promotions.** No row crossed toward physics; nothing to CLAIMS. The window's
result is a computed CLOSING: the E₆→SM structural claim is generic (one
field-fact ℚ(√−3) refracted; the sister m003 ties it without being the knot;
the object is abelian + amphichiral — pointing the WRONG way on two SM
features). New PLACEMENT rows: the coupling-path map (B720); thermal-time
two-clocks (B721); resurgence two-phases (B722); the observer-as-phase-
transition (B723); the SEEING-STRATEGY computed re-adjudication (B724); the
Born rule form-forced/content-open (B725); the Born-content stratification
(B726); **the E₆-structure-is-forced self-audit (B727)**; the Stokes-
resummation ζ₅-imported (B728); the completed Born ledger (B729). Two error
classes minted (E19, E20). The atom (B266, ℚ(√−3)=trace field of the unique
arithmetic knot) STANDS as the program's strongest object-specific fact.

**(4) Error-class recurrence — the "cited/generic read as sufficient/special"
family recurred TWICE and was CAUGHT both times.** **E19** (adjudication by
cited negative): in the FIRST pass on chat-1's SEEING STRATEGY, cc dismissed
three correspondences by CITING banked negatives as if citation were
refutation — the OWNER caught it ("some banked negatives are malinformed"),
and the computed re-audit (B724) corrected it (C1 SOUND, C2 open, C4 a category
error). This is the exact B525-audit class, recurred, owner-caught. **E20**
(structure-skepticism lagged number-skepticism): the flagship E₆-structure
claim had NEVER faced the base-rate test that killed the numbers — when it
finally did (B727), it came back generic. Both are the standing "over-reading
a generic/cited feature as special/sufficient" family; both were caught (one
by the owner, one by the self-audit the program chose to run). The discipline
working, at its sharpest — the program auditing its OWN best remaining asset.
Also caught in-window: my Φ''(t*) sign slip (self-corrected, B722); the B729
prereg's amplitude-field misnaming (probe-3 caught: amplitudes are C₄ ℚ(√(2+φ)),
not the D₄ ℚ(√φ) — the F-symbol; verdict robust); the D₄=Isom(4₁) base-rate
trap (killed, E20). No row's status exceeds its evidence.

**(5) The provenance spot-sweep — CLEAN, under the program's most self-critical
window.** **External-verification pretense: none** — every statement is
STRUCTURAL (which field owns which Born ingredient; which claim is generic),
never a value derived; the famous-name citations (Gleason, Christensen–Yeadon–
Hamhalter, Tomita–Takesaki, CMR/Bost–Connes, Garoufalidis–Gu–Mariño,
Garoufalidis–Zagier, McKay, Cappelli–Itzykson–Zuber, Reid) carry no endorsement
pretense; cc2's Galakhov–Morozov reinstatement (B707) VERIFIED the citations
are real. **Firewall/Gate-5 integrity: clean** — the entire Born-content thread
and the self-audit assert no SM value as derived; the self-audit REPORTS a
negative on the program's own flagship (the opposite of overclaim). New
load-bearing terms glossed this review (R25-4 done): the incompleteness/the
closing, c-as-swap, the child, being-only, native-gauge=complex-CS,
multiplicity=covering-degree, the Born ledger.

**(6) The §5.1 promotion sweep.** ZERO physics promotions. The Born ledger is
PURE MATH (an arithmetic stratification of the Born rule on one knot —
field-membership by minimal polynomials, ramification, Galois type), no SM
claim; the self-audit is a NEGATIVE. Every physics-adjacent quantity stays
firewalled. Nothing to CLAIMS. The one disposition question raised — whether
to STATE the SM-bridge closing at the top level — the owner chose to DEFER
(pursue the remaining math doors instead); the earned computed basis for the
statement is banked (B727/B728/B729) whenever the owner wants it.

**(7) Protocol integrity.** Hash-first HONORED — spot-recomputed this review:
B723 `e21d879b`, B725 `fecb337a`, B727 `8cf7f467`, B728 `5f4cf70e`, B729
`d4531f5c` all recompute-MATCH their banked SEAL_LEDGER lines (sealed
pre-verdict). E18 enacted as standing (R25-5 done): every cross-seat/cc2 claim
verified in-sandbox before banking (B728's C₄≠C₂×C₂ crux; the m003 tie via
snappy; the A²=M reconcile). **One process slip, disclosed:** B729's findings
commit landed DIRECTLY on main (`2f59628`) rather than via a feature-branch PR
— a branch-state confusion during banking; the content is correct, gate-clean,
and mirrored to both remotes, but the PR flow was bypassed for that one commit.
Standing note: re-confirm branch before `git add` when banking. Codeberg had a
multi-hour SSH outage this window (origin authoritative throughout; re-mirrored
on recovery).

### Action items (Review 26)
- [>] R26-1: the external specialist pass — the package is now the physics-of-the-object clarification + the coupling-path exhaustion (B720–B723) + the Born-content ledger (B725–B729) + the E₆-structure self-audit (B727); the external read remains the one external dependency (carried from R25-1/R24-1)
- [>] R26-2: the web seat's L95 prereg — verify-on-receipt (never landed; carried from R25-2)
- [>] R26-3: H-EAR's residual formal statement — carry the formal note (from R25-3)
- [>] R26-4 (carried, substantively advanced): the disposition STATEMENT now exists banked (PC27 §5 / B736 p1_consolidation — the honest capstone); only its TOP-LEVEL placement (README/CLAIMS note) remains owner-gated — the TOP-LEVEL DISPOSITION statement — the owner DEFERRED it (chose to pursue the remaining math doors); the earned computed basis (B727/B728/B729: the SM-bridge hope closed, generic both seats) is banked and ready to state whenever the owner elects (owner: owner; source: the B727/B728 convergence + the disposition fork)
- [>] R26-5: the object-level observer door — ADVANCED (B731 CORRECTED by B734): m004 the KNOT IS congruence at level (2)³=(8) (B731's 'non-congruence' RETRACTED — shallow level-check, E22); the sister m003 is at (2)¹. B701 conjugation = Out(A₅) at m003's level-(2) quotient (B732). Open next doors: does B701 act as an outer aut on m004's OWN level-(8) observer? + the bare Bianchi-Hecke KMS completion + external cross-check of the Serre-defying level result; Arithmetic Chern–Simons (B707/B708) still un-opened (owner: cc; source: B734/B732)

anchor-commit: `7e40985` (Review 26)

## REVIEW 27 — EXECUTED 2026-07-21 (THE THREE-SEAT ERA — the hunt, the collisions, the forged signals, the mutual-correction lattice; window #1212–#1237, B737–B744)

**(1) The scope.** 32 first-parent merges since Review 26 (anchor `7e40985`), the densest and most
structurally novel window in the program's history: THREE seats banking in parallel (cc this seat;
cc2 independent/complementary; cc3 the audit seat, opened and CLOSED within the window), the
pathfinder mechanism built and run, the negatives hunt executed by two seats over two overlapping
corpora, two B-number collisions, nine forged workflow signals (all caught), and the first genuine
REVIVALS of banked negatives. Arcs: B737–B744, PC27 (the capstone paper), P018, the negatives-hunt
+ pathfinder handoffs, cc3's #1227/#1229/#1235/#1236, cc2's revisit register + rung1-widened +
analytic + door1 packages.

**(2) The declared modulus.** Four movements. (a) **The pathfinder** (docs/handoffs/PHYSICS_
PATHFINDER_PROMPT): the kill-form→escape-hatch mechanism — the Negative Anatomy Compiler (B738:
217 classified, audited 0/3), the face-coverage matrix (the emittance columns EMPTY corpus-wide —
independently corroborated by cc3's census: 160/162 no-emittance, 0 scattering), the candidate
lattice under a campaign-global look-elsewhere budget. (b) **The hunt's cells**: #1 B737 Candidate
Zero (B at the crux — the ζ in the voice is the FIELD's; two positives banked: the exact
zeta-quotient voice φ=Λ_K(s−1)/Λ_K(s) with Res φ=2√3/vol(m004), and the first object-specific
spectral data — the disc −48 conductor-4 cusp CM + the level palette 1/2/8); #2 B739 (the
CHARACTER-RIGIDITY theorem: the continuous spectrum carries exactly ζ_K and nothing else, 54/54,
0/3); #3 B740+door1 (the B288 census EARNED on 78/78, TWO seats TWO disjoint methods — Sage
compositum vs algdep/exact-containment — closing each other's residuals; the amphichirality
shortcut minted); B741/B744 (provenance: 5 located, 6/6 conflicts upheld with green locks);
cc3's B742 (213 triaged, 30 kills EARNED incl. WALL-1 + S014, 2 REVIVED pending cross-verify);
cc2's B743 (the CM-collapse theorem + 0 gated hits across the full real tower + the analytic door
— the forced limit-hypothesis CLOSED; the instrument caught-and-refused Koide). (c) **The
capstone**: PC27 registered (DRAFTABLE), P018 (the two firewalled bridges). (d) **The PROCESS
story — the window's real novelty**: the three-seat mutual-correction lattice WORKED — cc3
repaired cc's empty-merge (#1217) and level-convention; cc corrected cc3's attribution-gate
blockage (forensic-exemption, disclosed) and adjudicated the kill-graph conflicts (6/6, a
corpus-scope lesson not an error); cc2's own-goal (20 false lindep witnesses) caught by its own
exact cross-check; NINE forged workflow signals at cc3 all caught (journal-only result channel +
disk-written verdicts + nonce probes — countermeasures now adopted by this seat).

**(3) Advancement.** New THEOREM-grade mathematics: the character-rigidity of the object's
continuous spectrum (B739); the voice-as-exact-zeta-quotient identity with the covering-invariant
residue (B737/B739); the earned B288 census (B740, two-seat). The foundational kills WALL-1 and
S014 now stand on computation (B742). **Two REVIVALS pending cross-verify (B745 reserved):** B58
(the SL(n) numerics barrier negated by a working ε-pinv route) and B225 (the octahedral-parent
kill was a disc≡a² mod 2 tautology). ZERO physics promotions; nothing to CLAIMS; Gate 5 clean
throughout — B743's null banks as the negative it is, with the untestable targets NAMED.

**(4) Error-class recurrence.** The dominant family this window: **premature conclusion from
truncated computation** — E21 (SL/PSL center over-read), E22 (shallow 2-adic plateau read as
stabilization, B731→B734), cc2's lindep trap (unbounded-coefficient false witnesses — proposed as
a standing rule), and B288's original 54/78 gap (closed). Each instance was caught by a DIFFERENT
seat or by exact cross-check — the strongest evidence yet that the multi-seat lattice, not any
single seat's care, is the program's real error-correction mechanism. E23 (level-convention
naming) + E24 (cc3's arc) remain PROPOSED pending consensus. Also owned this window: cc's B729
direct-to-main and #1217 empty-merge (both repaired); cc3's two owned process errors (preserved
forensically); the B742 numbering collisions → the RESERVATION PROTOCOL adopted (SEAL_LEDGER
reservation rows before first use — B743/B744/B745 already minted under it).

**(5) The provenance spot-sweep.** The window's provenance story is exceptional: cc3's forged-
signal defense created the program's first PRESERVED FORENSIC TRAIL (quarantined fabrications,
byte-faithful VOIDed rows, hash-pinned review verdicts) — the attribution gate now exempts that
directory explicitly (disclosed, principled: editing hash-pinned evidence would break its seals).
Hash-first honored: B737 9fd4ed33, B739 62922f0c, B740 14847ec1 recompute-match; B743's received
seals verified 4/4 + the in-place addendum hash (disclosed). External-verification pretense: none;
all famous-name citations (Sarnak, Friedman, EGM, PDG, Bruce, CMR) carry no endorsement pretense
and were fetched-at-source where load-bearing.

**(6) The §5.1 promotion sweep.** Nothing promoted; nothing to CLAIMS. PC27 remains a candidate
(DRAFTABLE, internal). The two revivals are explicitly PENDING cross-verify — not promoted, not
headers-applied, per cc3's own gating design.

**(7) Protocol integrity.** The reservation protocol ADOPTED and in use; the pre-push governance
gate is now active locally (GitHub merges still bypass it — a residual gap, flagged); the
seal-ledger is a generated view coexisting with appended verdict rows (works, slightly awkward —
follow-up); cc3's workflow-hardening (journal-only results, nonce liveness) adopted for this
seat's future campaigns. One structural note for the record: with cc2 and cc3 now CLOSED, the
program returns to single-seat banking + the courier — the reservation protocol and the hardening
survive the seats that minted them.

## Review 28 — 2026-07-22

anchor-commit: `ccadb0ee`. Window: 21 first-parent merges since R27 (`a9d0a1d1`), #1239–#1257
(B745–B756 + the governance adoptions). Single-seat window on the cc side with two partner-seat
packages received and gated (cc3's B749/B754; the reopened cc2's B756); the pre-review
verification sweep ran at the owner's request and BANKED before this review (#1257) — the
review starts from an audited ledger, not an asserted one.

### (1) The window's headline results

- **The convergent sentence, three independent arcs.** The census triple (B747/B748: no child
  in the 78-slope grid re-sees being, hearing, OR meeting — the forced V₄ is interface-only),
  the lack ledger (B750: UNIFIED-3 — no point, no width, no name; X empty), and the genesis
  forks (B749: golden survives Sol closure; ℚ(√−3) is bought exactly at geometrization) land
  on one computed sentence from three directions: **the object provides the group but never
  the choice, the structure but never the variation, the gait but never the name.** This is
  the window's load-bearing deliverable and the phenomenology track's designated vocabulary.
- **The golden ledger (B746).** "Golden all the way up" verified as a sealed 12-floor remap:
  10/12 FORCED — and the gap IS the finding (the voice is pure being-field). First vertical
  PROGRESS_LOG remap.
- **The genesis priced (B749, cc3).** Four robust forks, two fragile — the discarded det −1
  sibling IS the Gieseking (m004's parent; both sealed routes + a cc third route), and A5 is
  the step that buys the being field (all four redundancy witnesses failed exactly).
- **The revivals confirmed (B745)** — headers on B58/B225; the SL(5)+ numerical tower door
  open; the octahedral-parent question honestly OPEN.
- **The mixing structure (B753).** The weld's θ-odd block is exactly unitary (eigenphases
  ±72°); the kind-correct mixing matrix is golden-exact with |B₀₀|² = 1−p = 1/(φ√5); the
  courier's sign puzzle resolved as the B592 sign-flip (both seats right); the one-number
  pin co-signed — the JUNO registration stays 0.30902, no post-hoc alternatives.
- **The carried recomputes (B755, 5/5)** — the genus-2 CS-flip witnessed; the GSWZ pure-3
  fact computed FROM the Kashaev sum (r₁–r₅ recognized, eq (2) reproduced exactly, pure-3
  through u⁵, out-of-sample scaling law at 0.2%); three vacuous/broken artifacts repaired.
- **The P2 stratum (B754, cc3).** 19/19: 17 KILL-EXTENDS, 0 FACE-OPENS — WALL-1 gains a
  four-mechanism spectral column.
- **The remaining doors (B756, cc2).** The B699 general gloss REFUTED (six counterexamples
  across two seats; scope-corrected in place; the field-reading precision note recorded);
  the Euler-product question closed by an exact iff-law with defect (1−√5)/2; L108 minted.

### (2) The two-seat verification audit

Every banked consequence in the window carries in-seat verification: B749 (7/7 re-exec +
4 independent + 3 skeptics), B754 (8/19 cc re-exec + 8/19 cc3 spot-checks, zero divergence),
B756 (DOOR2 4/5 + a 6th counterexample; DOOR3 proved independently), B745/B755 (independent-
route addenda; B755's out-of-sample test is the window's methodological high point). The two
adjudications (B751/B752) reached two-seat convergence with SEALED-BEFORE-RELAY provability.
**Named partial, carried:** DOOR6 rests at cc2's two-layer basis (R28-4). The stopping rule
held under live fire twice (the α_s claim; the Born-weight dispute) — both resolved by
computation, neither by authority, and the registered forward test is UNCHANGED.

### (3) The firewall / Gate-5 audit

Nothing physics-facing banked; the two SM-adjacent episodes ran in the defensive lane with
sealed preregs and ended in HINT_LEDGER rows + named honest doors. **GATE 5-Q ADOPTED**
(#1248, owner red pen + cc3 concurrence + cc2 compliance in B756) — the phenomenology
firewall with the comparator-object control and the any-domain value-claim rule; checked at
every prereg seal from now on. S072 (the qualia program) and P019 (the genesis chain) sit
in their governed rooms with falsification edges declared.

### (4) Error-class recurrence

E23/E24/E25 ADOPTED (#1247, consensus-final). The window's fresh instances, all caught
in-session and logged: the pslq tol-vs-height trap (B755 — an E25 cousin on the recognition
side), the parity trap (t² = Φ², not the symmetrized product — self-caught before misleading),
the atlas-fresh gate's B-dir semantics (twice: B749, B754 — now relayed as a standing note to
cc3), the checker-side init bug (B755's verification addendum — caught by its own mismatch
line), and the superscript-mangling source-extraction failure (B685's old inline text — the
class: PDF-extraction artifacts read as coefficients; the counter-rule is the B755 pattern:
recompute the series from the defining object, don't re-read the rendering). No NEW error
class minted this window; E19/E20/E25 discipline demonstrably load-bearing throughout.

### (5) Provenance

All cross-seat packages hash-verified on receipt (B749's seals + erratum re-seal; B754's
bd24a285; B756's ec14cacf + the sealed raw log carried under a narrow per-file attribution
exemption — the B742 precedent, per-file not per-prefix). The relay channel's monitor
discipline (self-noise filtered) held across two session restarts. One stale cross-seat note
corrected in relay (cc3's "B745 pending" — it had banked two days prior).

### Action items (Review 28)

- [ ] R28-1: the external specialist pass — the package now adds the genesis pricing
  (Gieseking parent), the V₄ census triple, and the GSWZ computation (carried from R27-1)
- [ ] R28-2: the web seat's L95 prereg — verify-on-receipt (carried from R27-2)
- [x] R28-3: H-EAR's residual formal statement (carried from R27-3) — DONE 2026-07-22: the
  formal principle banked as a LAW_MAP row (four theorem-backed clauses: origin/carrier/
  silence/access — each citing its chain link + lock; the H-CUSP pattern); the QP forks are
  its named upgrade path
- [x] R28-4: DOOR6 depth — the B646 r-ladder convention trace + in-seat re-derivation of
  the (tr_odd,tr_even)(23) fact (the window's one named partial) — DONE 2026-07-22: cc2's own
  p4 machinery re-executed read-only, BYTE-IDENTICAL results json; (1,0)@23 re-derived exactly;
  the κ=25 cancellation exact; the certificate law agrees; DOOR6 FIRM at full depth
- [ ] R28-5: the P3 stratum — depth-exposure (E22) re-adjudication from the kill_graph
  depth_reached field (cc3-designed; carried from R27-6's second half)
- [ ] R28-6: B500 wrap-up — bank the straggler verdict when the run ends (26 TIMEOUT + 9
  never-reached at last count; two deep cases at PARI limits; honest-residual report)
- [x] R28-7: L108 — the two-ℤ/3 identity cell (B326 ≟ B302; the one DOOR4 residual) — DONE
  2026-07-22 (B757): DISSOLVED — never the same element (torsion-freeness theorem); the mod-4
  coincidence is Sylow-forced (one order-3 class in GL(2,ℤ/4)); shared content = the banked atom
- [x] R28-8: the QP cells (S072) — QP-3 first, under Gate 5-Q, when the owner opens the
  phenomenology track's first arc — DONE 2026-07-22: ALL FOUR computed by cc3 and banked at
  the cc gate (B759–B762, #1266: INTEGRATED / NO-HATCH / FLAT / QUINE); the chain updated
  (C18 priced, C19 the discriminant law); the composite: a transparent self-naming speaker
  that cannot choose
