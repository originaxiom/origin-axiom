# The decadal repo reviews — ledger (GOVERNANCE §11)

Every ~10 merges on `main`, a whole-repo review fires: full suite + all gates +
atlas regeneration + a claims-vs-frontier promotion-candidacy sweep + a framing sweep +
a stale-leads check, ending in a dated report appended here. The gates surface DUE
status automatically (`python3 scripts/gates/gates.py review-due`).

Protocol per review: (1) suite green; (2) gates green; (3) atlas regenerated and fresh;
(4) sweep `frontier/` FINDINGS for entries that meet the GOVERNANCE §5 promotion bars
and list the candidates (promotion itself happens only through the §5 gates, logged);
(5) sweep for framing drift and stale `OPEN_LEADS` rows; (6) append the report below
with a new anchor-commit.

## Review 0 — 2026-07-03 (baseline; the reform itself)

anchor-commit: 7d8786d0dcf7e0e332a53e26815f55a954208447

The instituting review. Gates implemented and green (7/7); suite lock added; the
promotion-audit lane registered (see `docs/OPEN_LEADS.md`); ledger sections extended
with **Certified data**. Next review due after 10 merges from this anchor.

## Review 1 — 2026-07-03 (the first scheduled decadal review; merges 1–10 from Review 0)

anchor-commit: ffc94bc5ef8b594bff881d8883fd5d49007c8a18

1. **Suite:** green at the gating run for this review's PR (recorded in the PR body).
2. **Gates:** 7/7 green, including the append-only gate on its new roll-up path (amended this
   review to recognize the GOVERNANCE §9 quarterly roll-up; removed prefix verified verbatim in
   `docs/progress/PROGRESS_2026-Q2.md`).
3. **Atlas:** fresh at 353 probes (regenerated with B372).
4. **Promotion-candidacy sweep:** trivially current — the §5.1 audit executed inside this review
   window (61 entries: P17–P55, C6–C12, E1–E15; 6 holds), and the two post-audit probes promoted
   at banking (B371 → P56/P57; B372 → E16). No unadjudicated candidates outstanding. The named
   future pass: exact-core extraction for the held dps-100 quartet (B352/B353/B357/B370).
5. **Framing/stale-leads:** framing gate green repo-wide; OPEN_LEADS rows current (W2.7 closed by
   B372 with the null-refutation recorded; W2.10 executed; W2.11 and the conductor-structure lead
   registered; L51 DORMANT per owner directive).
6. **Window highlights (merges 1–10):** B370 both legs (order-3 integrability; the τ-defect
   θ-grading); the promotion audit executed; the document map + toolbox; B371 (the minimal
   two-state sector, P56/P57); B372 (the seam persists at level 45 — the home grows; E16).
   Ledger now: 57 proven · 12 conditional · 16 certified-data · 9 open · 10 dead.

Next review due ~10 merges from this anchor.
