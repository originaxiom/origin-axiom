# The weave: what the joint action of every allowed move forces on every thread at once

cc (the SM-derivation seat), 2026-10-07. **Structure and proofs only. No count is read.** Written for the owner's rule,
stated daily for a year and given a fixed name today, **the weave** (`docs/THE_WEAVE.md`). The rule: reality comes from
the interaction of all the objects the principle allows, together, and not from single objects or from covers of one.
- A **thread** is one allowed object, a closed path of moves through the shared fibre.
- **The weave** is the joint action of all the moves on that fibre, and what it forces.

Nothing below is read off one thread. Each step is PROVED here and checked by the scripts beside this note, unless it is
marked READING or OPEN. Nothing is promoted, and 0 of 19 stands.

## The setting

- **The shared fibre** is the two records, F₂ = ⟨a, b⟩, with puncture loop [a, b] (GENESIS GM1, GM4).
- **The moves.**
  - L and R are GENESIS GM2.
  - The sign −I is GM5b, and the swap P is GM5c; both are OPEN in GENESIS.
  - The weave below uses all four. Where L and R alone give a different answer, both answers are stated.
- **The threads** are every hyperbolic word in the moves, with either sign.
  - To length 8 there are 2,554, and 1,308 of them have odd trace.
  - m000 (LP, the Gieseking manifold), m003 (−LR), m004 (+LR) and +LLLR are among them.
  - None is derived from another.

## W1. The three (`moves_and_parities.py`)

- **The parities.** Mod 2 the records have three non-zero parities: (1, 0), (0, 1) and (1, 1).
- **Each single move fixes exactly one of them and swaps the other two.**
  - L fixes (1, 0), R fixes (0, 1) and P fixes (1, 1).
  - −I fixes all three.
- **Any two of L, R and P generate all six permutations of the three** (GL(2, F₂) = S₃), and their product cycles all
  three.
- **So the three belongs to no single move.** It appears as three parities permuted with none distinguished only when
  moves act together.
- **Which threads cycle the three.** A thread cycles them exactly when its trace is odd (sm:B1550's parity lemma). That is
  1,308 of the 2,554 threads, m000, m003 and m004 among them.
- **GENESIS's SE1** (∣2 − tr φ∣ = 1, so tr φ is 1 or 3) admits only odd-trace threads.

## W2. The common point (`the_common_point.py`, part 1)

- **The moves act on the fibre's characters** (x, y, z) = (tr a, tr b, tr ab) by polynomial maps that keep tr [a, b].
- **One point is fixed by every move.**
  - The puncture is parabolic: tr [a, b] = −2, which is the Markov surface x² + y² + z² = xyz.
  - The ideal of points fixed by every move is then (x, y, z), so there is exactly one such point: the origin.
  - The origin is the quaternion representation a ↦ i, b ↦ j, ab ↦ k, [a, b] ↦ −1.
  - Without the cusp condition the moves fix one more point, (2, 2, 2), where the puncture is trivial.
- **Each thread fixes the origin and its own geometric points besides** (exact Gröbner bases):
  - ±LR: two points, the roots of z² − 3z + 3, the same two for m004 and m003, since the sign acts trivially on
    characters;
  - +LLR, +LLLR and +LLRR: four points each;
  - an orientation-reversing thread such as m000: its geometric point is fixed by the map followed by complex
    conjugation. The map itself fixes only the origin.
- **So the threads' geometries differ, and the one structure they all share is the quaternion point.**
  - A single shear already fixes only the origin on the Markov surface.
  - A single shear is not a thread.
- **On record.**
  - Main's B141 has the quaternion point as the unique irreducible fixed point of the metallic map.
  - Main's B148 places it on the Markov surface.
  - This seat's sm:B1538 has its character ζ_H invariant under every Anosov monodromy.
  - **New here:** it is the only point every move fixes.

## W3. The common point on every thread (part 2)

- **The quaternion point extends to every thread.**
  - t ↦ g in the binary octahedral group 2O, with g i g⁻¹ = ρ(φ(a)) and g j g⁻¹ = ρ(φ(b)).
  - There are two choices, ±g.
- **On all 2,554 threads to length 8 the image is the binary tetrahedral group 2T = SL(2, F₃), of order 24, exactly when
  the trace is odd.**
  - It is Q₁₆ when φ fixes one parity, and Q₈ when φ fixes all three.
  - Modulo ±1 it is the fibre-parity group: A₄, D₄ or V₄.
- **So the tetrahedral cover and the spin cover built on m004 are not m004's.** They are sm:B1550's and the held
  sm:B1551's.
  - They are the kernels of this common structure on one thread.
  - m000, m003, +LLLR and every odd-trace thread carry the same A₄ and the same 2T.

## W4. The triplet (part 3)

- **The shared fibre carries a three-dimensional space with one line for each non-zero parity.**
  - The space is the parity-twisted cohomology ⊕_χ H¹(F₂; χ), summed over the three non-trivial parity characters.
  - Each line is one-dimensional, because the punctured torus has Euler characteristic −1.
- **The moves and the fibre's own inner automorphisms act on it by signed permutations.**
  - The group they generate has order 48 and acts irreducibly: Σ tr² / ∣G∣ = 1.
  - L, R and the fibre alone generate a group of order 24, also irreducible.
- **Every odd-trace thread acts on it as an irreducible triplet.**
  - The group of the thread's monodromy and the fibre is A₄, of order 12, for m004, m003 and +LLLR.
  - For the orientation-reversing m000 it is A₄ × ℤ/2, of order 24.
- **Even-trace threads split it.** +LLRR splits it into three lines, and +LLR into 1 + 2.
- **It matches the quaternion axes thread by thread, not on the weave as a whole.**
  - On m004, m003 and +LLLR it is the same representation as the axes i, j, k under the common point, with equal traces on
    all 12 elements.
  - On m000 it is the same up to m000's orientation sign.
  - On the weave as a whole the two triplets are different representations. Together they generate 192 pairs.
- **Prior: the A₄ triplet of flavour physics.**
  - The triplet of A₄ flavour models: Ma and Rajasekaran (hep-ph/0106291); Altarelli and Feruglio (hep-ph/0504165).
  - Altarelli, Feruglio and Lin obtain the A₄ from the four fixed points of T²/ℤ₂ (hep-ph/0610165). Their ℤ/3 comes from a
    hexagonal torus.
  - Here no torus is special. The ℤ/3 is the monodromy mod 2 of any odd-trace thread, and the triplet is the weave's.
- **Prior: the mathematics.**
  - Looijenga's Prym representations, Geom. Dedicata 64 (1997), study the mapping class group on such twisted cohomology.
  - Goldman, Geom. Topol. 7 (2003), studies the modular group on the one-holed torus's characters.

## W6. What each line carries (`the_lines_census.py`, `the_lines.py`, `the_lines_content.py`)

**Theorem G, the lines carry alike (PROVED).**
- **Setting.** On an odd-trace thread M, N is its forced A₄ cover (W3) and M₃ = N/V₄ its third level.
- **A member's line** is the non-zero parity of the edge the member lives on, or of the one translation t_p that fixes it.
- **For an orbit of the deck group A₄ in which every member has a line:**
  - every member of a V₄ orbit has the same line;
  - the weave's 3-cycle carries line p to line φ(p);
  - a third of the orbit sits on each line;
  - on M₃ the orbit gives one sector per line, Ind from N of the member, cycled by the weave, each carrying the member's
    count.
- *Proof.*
  - V₄ is abelian, so a translation keeps a member fixed by t_p fixed by t_p.
  - Translations keep an edge's direction. An edge fixed by t_q has direction q, so the two labels agree.
  - The 3-cycle acts on V₄ by conjugation as φ mod 2 acts on the parities.
  - Shapiro's lemma carries the count to M₃. □
- **Scope.**
  - The proof uses only W3, so it holds on every odd-trace thread.
  - An orbit fixed by all of V₄ (size 3) sits on no single line.
  - The theorem does not say that any thread has members.

**The census (design-time structure, no count; the rule named before the run).**
- **The rule:** every odd-trace state of GENESIS to word length 6, twelve threads. On each thread, every A₄ orbit of
  characters of order dividing 4 (and, as a second pass, 3) on the forced cover, with the structure (h¹, r¹, n) of ν ⊗ ρ in
  route P.
- **A member** is a character with n > 0. A generation-shaped count needs one: Theorem C bounds I(Λ²W₁) between −n and 0.
  It also needs ν⁴ = 1 or a trivial end, by Lemma F′ (I(W₁) ≥ k − m_A − b0).
- **Precision.** The banked library runs unchanged, with its precision raised from the script: holonomy at 160 digits,
  modules at 100.
  - At 50 digits −LLLLLR's cover failed the library's own relator guard, and no reading was taken there.
  - At 100 digits the script reproduces sm:B1550's banked census of ±LR and ±LLLR exactly (54 and 6 members).

| thread | trace | order 4: characters, members | order 3: characters, members |
|---|---|---|---|
| +LR | 3 | 1024, 54 in 8 orbits | 81, 6 (m_A = 0) |
| −LR | −3 | 256, 6 in 1 orbit | 81, 6 (m_A = 0) |
| +LLLR | 5 | 256, none | 729, none |
| −LLLR | −5 | 1024, none | 81, none |
| +LLLLLR | 7 | 4096, none | 81, none |
| −LLLLLR | −7 | 256, none | 729, none |
| +LLLRLR | 13 | 256, none | 81, none |
| −LLLRLR | −13 | 1024, none | 729, none |
| +LLLRRR | 11 | 1024, none | running |
| −LLLRRR | −11 | 256, none | running |
| +LLRLRR | 15 | running | running |
| −LLRLRR | −15 | 256, none | running |

**Status at this commit: eleven of twelve threads read at order 4, and eight at order 3. The rest are running, and this
table is completed when they finish.**

- **Among the threads read, members appear only on the golden pair ±LR.**
  - The order-3 members there have m_A = 0 and ν⁴ ≠ 1, so Lemma F′ keeps them from being generations.
- **Generations, by sm:B1550's sealed two-route counts, appear only on +LR among the threads read.**
- **±LR are the only arithmetic odd-trace primitive threads** (Bowditch–Maclachlan–Reid, as reported by
  Goodman–Heard–Hodgson). Members fall exactly there: a pattern on twelve threads, not a theorem.

**What each line carries** (`the_lines_content.py`: the census, the lines and sm:B1550's banked counts joined; no count
computed).
- **+LR: every line carries six sectors on the third level,** each reading (−1, −1).
  - That is one generation of each of six types: two sign types, edge-labelled, and four order-4 types, fixed by t_p.
  - Up to the other order (complex conjugation) and the spin twist the six are three classes.
  - The two orbits fixed by all of V₄ read (1, 0), on no single line.
- **−LR: every line carries one sector reading (0, −3).** It is not a generation.
- **Every other thread read: nothing.**
- **In main's two standards (S79), +LR's three is the orbifold standard.** Per type it is three sectors of index one,
  distinguished by the parity characters and cycled by an order-3 symmetry.
  - The cover is forced, not chosen by a character.
  - Three is never selected.
- **Graded by THE BAR**, "only +LR carries" is a positive on one state, with p ≈ 0.29 on twelve threads. It is not
  claimed as a selection.

**The mixing (READING; `the_mixing.py`).**
- **The weave's group on the triplet is O_h,** with rotations S₄.
- **With the golden thread's 3-cycle as one sector's residual symmetry:**
  - the swap P (or L·a, R·b, LPL) as the other's gives TM1, the one pattern of its kind the data still allow (JUNO 2025);
  - the sign or a fibre translation gives TM2 (disfavoured);
  - a single shear gives θ₁₃ = 0 (excluded);
  - Klein groups give tri-bimaximal mixing (excluded) or democratic mixing (excluded).
- **Mod 2 the golden thread is ST,** the rotation fixing τ = ω, and the swap is S, fixing τ = i.

## What the weave gives, and what it does not

| step | status | what |
|---|---|---|
| W1 | PROVED | three non-zero parities, permuted with none distinguished only when moves act together |
| W2 | PROVED | one structure all threads share: the quaternion point |
| W3 | PROVED | on every odd-trace thread, the same A₄ and the same 2T from it |
| W4 | PROVED | one irreducible triplet, the same on every odd-trace thread; even-trace threads split it |
| W5 | READING (GENESIS FK14) | the three generations are this triplet: three, alike, carried into one another by the weave |
| W6 | PROVED; COMPUTED | Theorem G: whatever one line carries, all three carry; on +LR each line carries one generation of each type, and no other odd-trace thread to length 6 read so far carries any (eleven of twelve at order 4) |
| W6′ | OPEN | the chirality (the extension's order decides generation against anti-generation) and one module of index three (the smooth standard) |
| W6″ | READING | the weave's S₄ with the golden 3-cycle and the swap gives TM1 mixing |
| W7 | OPEN | which moves are in the weave (GENESIS GM5b, GM5c): the triplet's group has order 24 with L and R, 48 with all four |

- **In the owner's terms (READING).**
  - The three generations are on no object. They are the three parities of the shared records, and the weave makes them
    one triplet.
  - A thread with odd trace carries the whole triplet; every thread GENESIS's SE1 admits is such a thread. A thread with
    even trace breaks it.
  - The triplet does not depend on which thread is chosen.
- **What W6 settles, and what it does not.**
  - The frame that reads a generation (sm:B1515's F-HE) is built on one thread's own holonomy, so the content is read
    thread by thread.
  - The weave decides how it is shared, by Theorem G, and the census reads it on every thread by rule.
  - The synthesis against the physics is `docs/THREE_GENERATIONS_AND_THE_WEAVE.md`.
