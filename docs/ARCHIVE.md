# Archive and Deprecation Policy

This repo is intentionally kept clean and reproducible.

- Old exploratory notebooks, intermediate runs, and bulky experiment dumps should live in a separate legacy archive (outside git) unless explicitly promoted into a Phase with canonical artifacts.

Promotion rule:
Exploration → Phase candidate → bounded claims → canonical figures → reproducibility contract → merge.
