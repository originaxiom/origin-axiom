# Universe → Atoms Roadmap (Acts VI–VIII)

This note is for us (Biri + Dritëro) as an internal scaffold. It is *not* a final paper text, but a map of what we’re doing next and why.

We assume:
- Act II has delivered a flavour-informed prior for the master phase θ★.
- Acts III–V built the non-cancelling cancellation system, 1D twisted vacua, and the microcavity ΔE(θ★) toy.
- Act VI is the FRW + observable-corridor bridge on top of that.

The goal for Acts VI–VIII is to stitch **universe → vacuum → flavour → atoms** in a clean, rung-by-rung way, with explicit scripts and logs just like we did for the cosmology side.

## Act VI (status: in progress, cosmology bridge)

**Theme:** From microcavity ΔE(θ★) to an observable FRW + growth corridor that looks ΛCDM-like.

Already in place (via R9–R24):
- **R9–R10**: FRW observables for the effective vacuum slice (ΩΛ(θ★), t₀, q₀, d_L(z)).
- **R12–R16**: θ★-band scan + observable corridor cuts + linear growth D(a; θ★) and D_rel(a=1).
- **R19–R21**: Physical scales: ρ_Λ vs ρ_Pl, E_Λ ≈ few meV, relation to a reference ν-scale.
- **R22–R24**: Comparison of the θ★ corridor to an internal ΛCDM backbone (ages, distances, growth, σ₈-like proxy).

What Act VI is *claiming* at the end:
- A **continuous θ★ corridor** where the microcavity-backed effective vacuum produces:
  - ΩΛ ≈ 0.6–0.8,
  - t₀ ≈ 12–15 Gyr for H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc,
  - q₀ < 0 and a growth suppression D_rel(a=1) ≈ 0.73–0.83 relative to EdS.
- Inside this corridor, a θ★ slice close to the flavour fiducial (θ★ ≈ 3.6 rad) is **indistinguishable at the few-percent level** (for distances and growth) from an internal ΛCDM reference with (Ω_m, Ω_Λ) ≈ (0.3, 0.7).
- We are *not* yet predicting Λ from first principles; we are showing that the **same θ★ dial that works in flavour can live in a cosmologically acceptable window** once passed through the non-cancelling microcavity.

Act VI TODO (light-weight):
- [ ] Keep act6_theta_star_observable_corridor.tex synced with:
  - FRW band scan + observable corridor (R12–R13),
  - linear growth scan and σ₈-like ratios (R15–R16, R24),
  - ΛCDM backbone comparison (R22–R23),
  - physical scale pivot (R19, R21).
- [ ] One short “limitations & outlook” paragraph at the end of Act VI explicitly saying:
  - Scale is calibrated by hand via ΩΛ(fid) = 0.7.
  - Microcavity is 1D and highly idealised.
  - No real data is fitted yet; everything is an internal consistency check.

## Act VII: θ★, flavour, and microscopic mass scales

**Theme:** Connect the θ★ dial consistently back to the **quark+lepton sector and neutrino scales**, so the cosmology bridge is not floating in isolation.

Planned rungs (draft names):
- **R25: Flavour → θ★ snapshot (index rung).**
  - Script: collect the current Act II outputs (PMNS + CKM fits) into a compact JSON/NPZ snapshot:
    - θ★_fid, θ★ prior band, and a few representative flavour vacua.
    - Best-fit PMNS/CKM angles and phases at the θ★ fiducial (or small neighbourhood).
  - Purpose: single source of truth for “what flavour says about θ★ right now”.

- **R26: θ★ vs neutrino mass scales.**
  - Explore how the **few-meV vacuum scale** E_Λ relates to simple neutrino mass models:
    - Normal vs inverted ordering.
    - Rough ranges for Σ m_ν and individual m_i from standard oscillation fits.
  - Deliverable:
    - A script that takes a small grid of neutrino masses consistent with oscillation data and compares them to E_Λ.
    - A plot of “E_Λ / m_ν,ref” or “E_Λ vs m_lightest” to see if there is any non-ridiculous alignment (purely exploratory, clearly labelled as such).

- **R27: Non-cancelling rule as a selection in flavour space.**
  - Introduce a *toy* cancellation-system cost function in flavour-space (e.g. penalising combinations of Yukawas/mixing angles that produce “too cancelling” structures).
  - Check whether the current θ★ band lies in a basin of low cost.
  - This stays purely phenomenological, but sets up a future story where the same non-cancelling principle that shapes the vacuum also disfavors “over-cancelling” flavour structures.

- **R28: Act VII text (θ★ as the shared dial).**
  - Write act7_theta_star_flavour_and_masses.tex as a narrative bridge:
    - Start from the flavour prior and microcavity band,
    - Introduce the meV E_Λ slice,
    - Discuss neutrino-scale cross-checks,
    - End with a clear statement of what is **suggestive** vs what is **not yet a prediction**.

## Act VIII: From θ★ vacuum to atoms and lab observables

**Theme:** Show that a θ★-labelled vacuum can, in principle, leave **small but structured fingerprints in atomic/condensed-matter scales**, even if the current model is still very toy.

Planned rungs (draft names):
- **R29: Toy coupling of E_Λ to an atomic scale.**
  - Take a minimal toy model (e.g. hydrogen-like energy level, or a simple lattice with a bound state).
  - Let one parameter (mass, coupling, or background potential) depend weakly on θ★ via the same non-cancelling rule.
  - Quantify how big the induced fractional shift would be in a lab-scale observable (energy level, phonon frequency, etc.).
  - The goal is *sign and scaling*, not an actual prediction for a specific atom.

- **R30: Sanity bounds from existing precision tests.**
  - Cross-check that any θ★-induced shifts we play with in R29 are not already ruled out by precision measurements of atomic spectra or equivalence-principle tests (even in back-of-envelope form).
  - This will likely constrain how strongly we are allowed to couple θ★ to ordinary matter in future, more realistic models.

- **R31: Act VIII text and global “Universe → atoms” stitch.**
  - Draft act8_theta_star_atoms_and_observables.tex with:
    - A clear description of how the non-cancelling rule and θ★ move from:
      - 1D twisted vacua → microcavity ΔE(θ★),
      - → effective vacuum ΩΛ(θ★) and FRW,
      - → flavour priors and neutrino-scale checks,
      - → toy atomic / condensed-matter sensitivities.
    - A brutally honest “status” section:
      - What is actually computed and reproducible in the repo.
      - Where the free knobs still are (e.g. scaling S, toy couplings).
      - What would need to be done for a **real** prediction (e.g. embedding in a concrete QFT, matching to data).

## Near-term priorities (what we should actually do next)

After R24 and the Act VI file, the next concrete steps are:

1. **R25 – Flavour → θ★ snapshot (implementation)**
   - Write a small script, e.g. `scripts/build_theta_star_flavour_snapshot.py`, that:
     - Reads the Act II outputs (current format: PMNS/CKM cards + θ★ prior config),
     - Produces a compact JSON/NPZ file with θ★_fid, prior band, and a handful of flavour observables at that slice.
   - Log it in PROGRESS_LOG with a short “what this rung adds”.

2. **R26 – θ★ vs neutrino scales (exploratory)**
   - Implement a self-contained script (no external data) that:
     - Hard-codes a reasonable oscillation-consistent set of neutrino masses (normal ordering),
     - Computes E_Λ from the effective vacuum (we already have this from R21),
     - Prints and optionally plots simple ratios like E_Λ / m_ν,ref and E_Λ / Σ m_ν.
   - Make sure it is clearly labelled as “exploratory sanity check, not a prediction”.

Once these two rungs exist and are logged, we’ll be ready to:
- Write an initial Act VII skeleton .tex file,
- Decide where, if anywhere, the non-cancelling rule is allowed to actually talk to Standard Model couplings without contradicting existing data.

This roadmap file is meant as our **living checklist**.
When a rung is completed and logged, we can come back here, tick it off, and update paths / filenames if they move.
