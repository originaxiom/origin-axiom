## 5. Companion docs: FRW promotion gate and Phase 5 roadmap

Two companion docs provide additional structure around FRW and Phase 5 promotions:

- `docs/FRW_CORRIDOR_PROMOTION_GATE_v1.md` defines the minimum conditions under
  which Stage 2 FRW corridor results may be promoted into Phase 5 (or a future
  FRW-focused phase). Until that gate is passed, all FRW corridor diagnostics
  remain Stage 2 exploratory work and must not be described as physical
  predictions.

- `docs/phase5_roadmap.md` sketches a roadmap for Phase 5 as an interface and
  sanity layer sitting on top of the Phase 3 mechanism and Phase 4 FRW toys. It
  is planning text, not a claims document, and should be read together with this
  promotion design when deciding which Stage 2 artifacts, if any, might be
  elevated into Phase 5 text in future rungs.

## 6. Documentation and repo-audit preconditions

Any future promotion of Stage 2 artifacts into Phase 3/4/5 text or figures
must also pass basic documentation and repo-audit checks. In particular:

- The Stage 2 documentation/repo-audit belt should be in a clean state, with
  its status recorded in `stage2/docs/STAGE2_DOC_AUDIT_SUMMARY_v1.md` and
  relevant rungs logged in `PROGRESS_LOG.md`.

- Global docs (`docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/PHASES.md`,
  `docs/STATE_OF_REPO.md`, `docs/CLAIMS_INDEX.md`, and
  `docs/FUTURE_WORK_AND_ROADMAP.md`) and the repo atlas
  (`docs/REPO_MAP_AND_ATLAS_v1.md`) should already reflect the intended role of
  the promoted artifacts (for example, as diagnostics, negative-result checks,
  or narrow corridor illustrations).

- Archive boundaries and experiment status should be clear in
  `docs/ARCHIVE.md`, `docs/GATES_AND_STATUS.md`, and
  `stage2/docs/STAGE2_ARCHIVE_STATUS_v1.md`, so that promotions do not
  accidentally re-canonise archived or sandbox material.

These conditions are part of the promotion gate: Stage 2 artifacts are only
eligible for promotion once both their numerical robustness and their
documentation/provenance are consistent with the Phase 0 contracts.
