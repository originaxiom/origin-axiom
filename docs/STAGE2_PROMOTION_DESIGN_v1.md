## 5. Companion docs: FRW promotion gate and Phase 5 roadmap

Two companion docs provide additional structure around FRW and Phase 5 promotions:

- `docs/FRW_CORRIDOR_PROMOTION_GATE_v1.md` defines the minimum conditions under
  which Stage 2 FRW corridor results may be promoted into Phase 5 (or a future
  FRW-focused phase). Until that gate is passed, all FRW corridor diagnostics
  remain Stage 2 exploratory work and must not be described as physical
  predictions.

- `docs/phase5_roadmap.md` sketches a roadmap for Phase 5 as an interface and
  sanity layer sitting on top of the Phase 3 mechanism and Phase 4 FRW toys. It
  is planning text, not a claims document, and should be read together with this
  promotion design when deciding which Stage 2 artifacts, if any, might be
  elevated into Phase 5 text in future rungs.
