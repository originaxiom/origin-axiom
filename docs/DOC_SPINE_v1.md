# Origin Axiom doc spine (Stage 2 snapshot)

Status (2026-01-11): This file tells a new reader which small set of docs to read first, and then points to the full repo atlas. It does not introduce new claims.

## 1. If you only read a few files, read these

In this order:

1. `README.md`  
   Front-door description of the Origin Axiom program, phases, Stage 2, and links to the phase PDFs.

2. `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`  
   Narrative overview of the motivation, the axiom, and the phased structure.

3. `docs/PHASES.md`  
   Phase-by-phase description of roles for Phase 0–5 and Stage 2.

4. `docs/STATE_OF_REPO.md`  
   Current status of each phase, Stage 2 belts, and archived experiments in this snapshot.

5. `stage2/docs/STAGE2_MASTER_VERDICT_v1.md`  
   Stage 2 master verdict for the current toy universe: FRW bands, corridor structure, mechanism diagnostics, joint mech–FRW redundancy, θ★ status.

Reading these five files gives a coherent picture of what the program is, what has been done, and what the current toy-universe verdict is.

## 2. Full repo map and atlas

For a structural view of all major directories and docs, see:

- `docs/REPO_MAP_AND_ATLAS_v1.md`

That file is the canonical “atlas” for the repo: it explains the directory layout, phase trees, Stage 2 belts, and where experiments and sandbox material live.

## 3. Where to go next

After the spine and the atlas, typical next steps are:

- To understand claims and governance:
  - `docs/CLAIMS_INDEX.md`
  - `docs/GATES_AND_STATUS.md`
  - `docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md`

- To see how to interact with the repo:
  - `docs/INTERACTING_WITH_REPO.md`

- For future directions:
  - `docs/FUTURE_WORK_AND_ROADMAP.md`
  - `docs/phase5_roadmap.md` (Phase 5–focused view)

- For Stage 2 structure:
  - `stage2/docs/STAGE2_BELT_OVERVIEW_v1.md`
  - `stage2/docs/STAGE2_OVERVIEW_AND_PROMOTION_MAP_v1.md`
  - `stage2/docs/STAGE2_DOC_AUDIT_SUMMARY_v1.md`
  - `stage2/docs/STAGE2_ARCHIVE_STATUS_v1.md`
  - `stage2/docs/STAGE2_PAPER_AUDIT_OVERVIEW_v1.md`

This spine is a navigation aid only; the actual program definitions remain in the phase contracts, alignment memos, and Stage 2 verdict docs.
