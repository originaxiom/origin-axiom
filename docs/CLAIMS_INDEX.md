# Claims Index (Global)

This file is the top-level map of claims across phases.

Rule: every claim must have:
- a stable claim ID,
- a phase owner,
- evidence pointers (canonical figures and/or pinned run IDs),
- an explicit "non-claim" boundary.

## Phase 1
- Source of truth: `phase1/CLAIMS.md`

## Phase 2
- Source of truth: `phase2/CLAIMS.md`

## Phase 0 (meta-claims)
Phase 0 contains method/governance claims only:
- schema correctness,
- reproducibility contract,
- corridor bookkeeping discipline.
