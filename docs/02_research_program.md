# The Origin Axiom Research Program

The Origin Axiom is not a finished theory of everything, but a **root constraint** from which a hierarchy of structures should, in principle, be derivable. The research program built around it asks:

> *If reality is compelled to exist and structurally forbidden from ever reaching a state of perfect cancellation, how much of the observed universe can we recover from that single fact, implemented through a non-cancelling phase $\theta_\*$ on a scalar backbone?*

The aim is not to decorate physics with a philosophical slogan, but to construct and test a sequence of models that either vindicate or falsify the axiom as a plausible foundation.

## 1. A $\theta_\*$-Agnostic Scalar Framework

Rather than hard-wiring a favorite constant (such as $\varphi$ or $\varphi^\varphi$) into the laws, we treat the fundamental phase $\theta_\*$ as a **free parameter** subject only to the non-cancelling constraint.

The first task is to define a **minimal class of toy universes** where:

1. The Origin Axiom is implemented explicitly as a restriction on field configurations (a “hole” in configuration space around a cancelling configuration).
2. Some notion of locality, causality, and energy flow emerges.
3. Nontrivial structure (stable patterns, propagating excitations, quasi-classical domains) is possible for at least some values of $\theta_\*$.

These toy models do **not** need to reproduce our universe in detail. Their job is to reveal what kind of “worlds” are compatible with non-cancelling existence, and how $\theta_\*$ qualitatively shapes their behavior.

## 2. The Selection Problem for $\theta_\*$

If the axiom is to explain more than it assumes, $\theta_\*$ cannot remain arbitrary. Within the $\theta_\*$-agnostic framework, we seek **internal** and **external** constraints that narrow the allowed values of $\theta_\*$.

**Internal constraints** come from the mathematical structure of the models:

- stability of the vacuum,
- boundedness of energy,
- existence of long-lived excitations,
- robustness of quasi-classical regimes,
- avoidance of pathologies (runaway instabilities, trivial frozen phases).

**External constraints** come from our actual universe:

- the universe supports complex chemistry and long-lived structures,
- large hierarchies of scale exist (from particles to galaxies),
- the observed vacuum energy is tiny but non-zero,
- quantum coherence and decoherence behave as seen in experiments.

The guiding hope — still an open question — is that when these constraints are imposed, **only a narrow band of $\theta_\*$ values survives**, and perhaps a specific number (or small family of numbers, potentially related to special constants) is singled out as **physically viable**.

## 3. Bridging to Established Physics

Any attempt to ground reality in a non-cancelling scalar backbone must eventually reproduce, approximate, or at least illuminate key features of general relativity and quantum field theory.

In practice, this means constructing regimes in which the dynamics of $\Phi$ can be mapped onto effective geometries and gauge structures:

- curvature encoded in gradients / second derivatives of $|\Phi|$,
- approximate gauge symmetries emerging from phase redundancies or topology,
- effective “particles” appearing as localized, stable defects or solitons.

We must also check whether the framework can naturally generate ingredients we currently treat as independent:

- vacuum energy scales,
- mass hierarchies and mixing patterns,
- decoherence behavior,
- specific dimensionless combinations that appear in the Standard Model and cosmology.

The program is explicitly **incremental**: we do not expect to derive the full Standard Model at once, but to accumulate concrete overlaps (and clear failures) in well-defined limits.

## 4. Methodology: Code, Transparency, and Falsifiability

Because the Origin Axiom is a global, structural constraint, many of its consequences may be hard to see analytically. A central part of the work is a **public, version-controlled repository** of models, simulations, and tests:

- code that evolves scalar fields under different choices of $\theta_\*$ and parameters,
- scripts that scan parameter space for stability and structure,
- tools to compute observables and compare them to known physics.

This serves three purposes:

1. **Transparency** – clear record of what has actually been tried.
2. **Collaboration** – concrete starting point for others to engage and extend.
3. **Falsifiability** – each model makes specific claims; simulations and derived observables yield yes/no questions.

## 5. Beyond Physics: Higher-Level Systems

If the universe is, at root, a non-cancelling process in which every attempted “zeroing out” leaves a residue, this principle offers a lens on **higher-level systems**:

- thermodynamic irreversibility and entropy,
- information loss and preservation,
- emergence of memory and agency,
- design of human institutions and technologies that avoid “hidden residues” (corruption, externalities, unaccounted costs).

These directions are long-term and speculative. The immediate focus of the research program is to:

1. Formalize the axiom.  
2. Construct $\theta_\*$-agnostic toy models.  
3. Derive and test constraints.  
4. Attempt selection of $\theta_\*$.  
5. Compare with established physics.

Only if these steps succeed do we seriously extend the axiom to questions of meaning, value, and “crap-free” organization of human systems.
