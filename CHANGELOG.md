## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Full audit of all prior work: `AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `PROVENANCE.md`.
- Phase 0 governance scaffolding: `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CLAIMS.md`, `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`,
  `PROGRESS_LOG.md`, this changelog, `REPRODUCIBILITY.md`, `docs/ARCHIVE.md`, `.gitignore`.
- Claims ledger established: 10 `proven`, 4 `conditional`, 9 `open`, 10 `dead`.
- `legacy/` — prior history consolidated: curated text under `legacy/reports/`,
  `legacy/handoff/`, with the ~4 GB raw archive git-ignored under `legacy/raw/`.
- Phase A: the `origin_axiom` package (`src/`) and `tests/` suite locking every
  `proven` claim P1–P10 — 33 passing tests. Packaging via `pyproject.toml`.
- Session-3 integration: claims P11–P13 promoted to the proven core (exact-algebra
  results — sl(2) decomposition of `log A`, gluing-equation factorization,
  isospectrality), with tests (suite now 39 passing). Frontier probes B4
  (BKL/Gutzwiller) and B5 (Wheeler-DeWitt) added as logged observations.
- **Phase C kickoff** — `paths/` directory created: 25-path registry (20
  mathematizable E1–E20 across 11 mechanism classes; 5 philosophical P1–P5 in a
  separate register). The project's goal becomes *exhaustively surveying* the
  mechanisms by which "nothing being unstable" could produce reality, with the
  *map of attempted paths* as the deliverable. First batch selected: E14, E11, E5.
- **Session-3 synthesis** — the 2025 field-theory line reconnected to the algebraic
  skeleton. Claims **P15** (Möbius generating vector field `v(τ)=−κ(τ²−τ−1)`) and
  **P16** (derived potential `V(τ)=κ(τ³/3−τ²/2−τ)`) promoted to the proven core as
  exact algebra about A, with tests (`src/origin_axiom/mobius.py`,
  `tests/test_mobius_vector_field.py`, `tests/test_derived_potential.py`). Frontier
  probes **B6–B9** added (field equation, Fisher–KPP creation, particle spectrum
  with the non-exact `m/g≈φ` near-miss, fusion–scattering shared polynomial), each
  with caveats. Synthesis doc + scripts under `docs/SESSION3_SYNTHESIS.md` and
  `scripts/`. Four Oct-2025 genesis documents filed under `legacy/reports/genesis/`
  (historical only). Ledger: **15 `proven`**, 4 `conditional`, 9 `open`, 10 `dead`.
- Roadmap integration started with `docs/atlas/INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md`, a
  public-safe manifest for migrating atlas, paper-candidate, campaign-synthesis,
  and review-packet material from private staging into the canonical repository.
- Research Atlas skeleton added under `docs/atlas/`: auditor guide, research
  tree, failure atlas, success atlas, glossary, and simulator ecosystem map. This
  is a navigation layer only; governed claims remain in `CLAIMS.md`.
- Paper-candidate registry added under `papers/`: candidate index, artifact
  manifest, and first paper cards for conditional uniqueness, noncommutative
  residue, and the quantum selector / state-integral bridge problem.
- Quantum selector campaign summarized under `docs/atlas/campaigns/`: public-safe
  synthesis of the 232-cycle run, preserving verdict counts, survivors, killed
  routes, stalled bridge classes, and theorem questions without raw run artifacts.
- PC02 validation packet added, giving readers a concise audit path for
  the conditional uniqueness theorem, its tests, caveats, and missing topology
  lemma.
- Noncommutative cancellation residue dossier added as an atlas node, with the
  PC04 paper card updated to point at canonical atlas evidence and the campaign
  synthesis.
- State-integral selector-gap dossier added as an atlas node, with the PC06 paper
  card updated to frame the route as an expertise-bound theorem question rather
  than a solved bridge.
- Atlas/paper integration roadmap closed through R7: manifest now marks R0-R6
  complete and records the final QA, merge, and tag gate for
  `atlas-paper-integration-v1`.
- Post-merge manifest cleanup: R7 marked complete after merge/tag, and stale
  closure wording removed. Existing `atlas-paper-integration-v1` tag left
  unchanged.
- PC02 paper-support lemma added: mapping-torus homology/torsion proof for the
  conditional uniqueness theorem, with PC02 paper card and review packet updated
  for external mathematical review.
- PC02 validation brief added, and PC02 readiness advanced from
  `EVIDENCE_EXISTS` to `NEEDS_VALIDATION` pending independent mathematical
  validation.
- Conditional uniqueness theorem formalized: `docs/UNIQUENESS_THEOREM.md` and
  `tests/test_uniqueness_theorem.py` lock the machine-checked algebra
  `A1-A7 -> A=LR` up to order, while keeping C1 conditional.
- Trace-map character-variety frontier campaign B13-B25 added. B18 establishes
  the canonical half-step trace lift; B22 kills the special parity narrative
  while preserving the special `A` quadratic sector; B25 records the Fibonacci
  spectrum at dimensionless `lambda/h=1` as a finite-approximant numerical
  anchor, initially classified as motivated, not derived. No claims promoted.
- Trace selector package added: B26-B47 refine the `lambda/h=1` selector, and
  `docs/TRACE_SELECTOR_THEOREM.md` formalizes conditional claim C5:
  `T1 -> S1 -> I=1/4 -> lambda/h=1`. The selector is conditional on T1, not
  proven or physical.
- PC11 validation packet added, plus `papers/REVIEWABILITY_INDEX.md` routing
  PC02 and PC11 through reviewability and falsifiability checks. PC11 readiness
  advances to `NEEDS_VALIDATION`, pending independent validation of T1.
- Reviewability/falsifiability workflow added: `papers/VALIDATION_WORKFLOW.md`,
  `papers/VALIDATION_LEDGER.md`, PC02 `REVIEWABILITY_CHECKLIST.md`, and
  validation briefs replace communication-oriented artifacts. No person-specific
  names or private correspondence are tracked in the repo.
- Falsifiability matrix added: `papers/FALSIFIABILITY_MATRIX.md` maps PC02,
  PC04, PC06, PC07, and PC11 to missing objects, validation questions, and
  kill/rescope conditions. PC07 now has a paper card, and public-surface hygiene
  is covered by `tests/test_public_surface_scan.py`.
- Metallic `SL(3)` trace-map intake added: B48 generalizes the B27 `m=1`
  Fibonacci trace lift to the family `a -> a^m b, b -> a`; PC12 now tracks the
  standalone arithmetic candidate with certificate-backed fixed-line controls.
  Raw side-work bundles remain private and are not copied into the repo.
- B49 proof-hardening added for PC12: the fixed-line splitting classification is
  decomposed into a universal splitting criterion, direct split families,
  square-gap propagation, finite strip exclusions, and negative boundary
  controls. PC12 remains `NEEDS_VALIDATION`.

### Changed
- Project framing locked to the disciplined V4 / Reality-Check line; the optimistic
  `handoff.md` framing demoted to historical record.

### Notes
- This repository consolidates four prior GitHub repositories and the May-2026 session
  archive into a single canonical home.
- The four prior repositories (`origin-axiom-framework`, `origin-axiom-theta-star`,
  `origin-axiom-obstruction`, `00_origin-axiom`) have been archived read-only with
  "superseded by" pointers. They are preserved, not deleted.
