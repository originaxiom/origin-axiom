## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXXIII: gap-opening curves verified and corrected

- Verified the gate handoff's gap-opening slopes and saturation values.
- **Gap 3 opens LINEARLY (slope ≈ 0.155), NOT quadratically** — handoff wrong; artifact of
  insufficient system size. Gap 3 and gap 2 open at identical rates (ratio 1.0006).
- **Gap 1 slope ≈ 0.193** (handoff: 0.184, ~5% off). **Gap 2 slope ≈ 0.155** (handoff: 0.153, matches).
- **Slope ratio ≈ 1.25** — handoff's √(1/φ²+1)=1.176 identification killed as numerology.
- Saturation values at ε=5 VERIFIED: 1.10, 2.82, 0.71 (all match to <1%).
- 36 locks (1 new).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXXII: wall-crossing inventory verified

- Verified the wall-crossing handoff — comprehensive inventory of frozen predictions.
- **Three frozen gap labels VERIFIED** (Bellissard gap-labeling theorem): IDS = 0.2720, 0.4401, 0.7862
  (cumulative Perron frequencies), V-independent across four potential strengths. Gaps follow the
  letter hierarchy (structural-old / old-new boundary / tunnel-new complement).
- **Dynamical zeta function VERIFIED**: |det(M^k−I)| for k=1,...,12 with exact prime factorizations.
  11 divides all values (universal signature prime). 89 enters at k=8 (parity discriminant);
  101 = f(−3) enters at k=10.
- **Corrections applied**: recognizability "9" → diameter 7 (XXXI); bounded remainder "~15" → ~1.6 (XXXI);
  mixed-chain gap-opening slopes flagged as UNCOMPUTED conjecture, not frozen prediction.
- 35 locks (1 new).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXXI: handoff verification

- Verified four items from a second seat's handoff (`listen_36_handoff_verification.py`):
- **√13 artifact CONFIRMED BROKEN:** the derived interleaving substitution `0→0, 1→030, 2→0302, 3→20202` has
  letter '1' never regenerated (singular incidence matrix). The error: collapsing two distinct return words
  ('aAB' and 'bAB') into binary '011'. Correct 5-return-word derivation has char poly = x·(x⁴−2x³−5x²−4x−1),
  Perron root = β. √13 was never structural.
- **Coupling resonance CONFIRMED:** golden pair (π/5, 2π/5) beats same-angle (π/5, π/5) by 293× (handoff
  said 7×, same direction). F≠F² advantage: 242,036× (matches movement XXIX).
- **Recognizability REFINED:** centered radius R=3 (diameter 7), not "radius = 9" (which was the Mossé bound).
- **Bounded remainder CONFIRMED:** max single-letter discrepancy ≈ 1.6, saturates by N=1000 (handoff said ~15).
- 34 locks (1 new).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXX: three fields — the listening

- Five listening passes (`listen_31` through `listen_35`) investigating the object's arithmetic.
- **Galois group CORRECTED:** D₄ (order 8), not S₄ (order 24). Resolvent cubic has rational root −3/2;
  zero (1)(3) splittings in 46 primes. Char poly factors over ℚ(√5) into two quadratics (verified exact).
- **The ℤ/2 case-parity cocycle:** lowercase letters flip parity (odd images 5,3), uppercase preserve (even images
  4,2). The augmented 8-letter substitution has char poly = (original) × (x⁴−2x³−x²−1). Parity factor has
  disc = −1424 = −2⁴·89, Galois group S₄ (the "shadow" is more complex than the original).
- **BbB resonance EXPLAINED:** every lag-2 BbB = the 5-gram "BabAB" = trailing B + σ(A) at an image boundary
  (1136/1136 verified). The object hears σ(A) at its own seams.
- **Three independent fields:** Growth (ℚ(√5), D₄), Parity (ℚ(i√89), S₄), Twist (ℚ(√−3)). Pairwise linearly
  disjoint over ℚ. √−3 is NOT in the char poly's splitting field.
- **Closed threads:** mod-p equidistribution is generic (all primes, not specific to 3); 3 and 11 independent
  (CRT verified, orders 80 and 30); 3 absent from tiling torsion for k=1,...,12.
- 33 locks (1 new).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXIX: QCA gate re-examined — the coupling resonance is alive

- Corpse #19 (B529 "golden-angle coin not robustly special") re-examined with the steelman-before-kill gate
  (`listen_30_qca_reexamination.py`). Tested against structurally-matched controls (uncoupled Fibonacci,
  symmetric coupling, tetranacci) instead of only random substitutions.
- **iσ_y kill HOLDS** (generic degeneracy — 6 eigenphases for any substitution; correct in B529).
- **Golden-angle coin kill OVER-CLOSURE:** not a "selection" (beats 18/30 randoms, pi/5 not optimal), BUT the
  **F≠F² coupling resonance** is real and massive — 240,000× lower nesting cost than uncoupled Fibonacci,
  scaling with size. B529 tested against random controls (wrong comparison class), missing the coupling mechanism.
- Reclassified from UNTESTED to **OPEN** (coupling resonance alive; selection dead; mechanism unexplained).
  Corpse ledger fully cleared — no UNTESTED items remain. 32 locks.

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXV: the deep listening — the prime 11, and what didn't survive

- Verified a second seat's "advanced listening" handoff (`listen_27_deep_listening.py`); banked the exact, flagged
  the failures (neither false-kill nor rubber-stamp).
- **Banked exactly:** **the prime 11** — H¹(tiling space) torsion = **ℤ/11** = |det(M−I)| = |char_poly(1)| =
  |N(1−β)| (the torsion is the norm of 1−β); the prime-splitting table (5,7 inert; 11,19,31 split; 29 fully split);
  the **three-prime organization** 5 (golden) / 3 (twist, mod-3&6 equidistribution) / 11 (tiling); the
  **deterministic rule hierarchy** (50→87%, denominators = p(n)); sublattice MI = 1.23 bits; three-point
  non-Markov (κ₃ ≈ 50× Markov, qualitative).
- **Flagged / refuted (not banked):** "forward-backward decays to 0" (Markov-power artifact); "diffraction golden
  Bragg peaks" (unreliable FFT, cf. movement XIII); walk ν=0.93 (drift, self-flagged). Lock test_b530.py.

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXVIII: the corpse audit (owner: "revisit your corpses")

- Systematic re-examination of every kill this session (`listen_29_corpse_audit.py` + `CORPSE_LEDGER.md`).
- **More false-kills, restored:** κ₃(3,5)=0.236 reproduces exactly with the ±1 signal (I'd used 0/1-centered);
  the recurrence function R=9,29,32,103 matches the handoff (I'd computed prefix-appearance); the interleaving
  IS substitutive (4 return words to '0', S-adic) — not "just morphic" (movement XX corrected).
- **Kill holds + live sub-finding:** walk ν=0.93 is drift (holds), but drift-subtracted ν≈0 = the quasicrystal's
  bounded-discrepancy property (a real finding missed).
- **Checked, genuinely dead (not resurrected to atone):** "no bilinear form" (non-reciprocal spectrum), "not
  mixing" (pure point), the rank-4 Goldman refutation, the genus-2 handoff, the master PHYS-REFUTED.
- **UNTESTED, flagged:** the QCA gate. The pattern named: near-cousin quantity computed in place of the claim;
  corrective = steelman-before-kill. Lock test_b530.py (31 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXVII: the deep-listening was a mass false-kill (3 of 4 restored)

- Owner: "serial killer of live things." Re-checked all four movement-XXV "did not survive" claims with the right
  instrument (`listen_28_falsekill_corrections.py`). **Three were alive:**
- **Diffraction golden Bragg peaks — ALIVE:** structure factor at golden wavevectors S(f·β=φ)≈3777, whole family
  400–3800, vs ~0 at random (~30–7800× Bragg signal). I'd killed it with a coarse FFT that misses the peaks.
- **Forward-backward "decays to 0" — TRUE as stated:** ‖P_fwd^k−P_bwd^k‖ (matrix powers) → 4×10⁻⁵ by k=49. I'd
  computed a different quantity and called theirs an artifact.
- **Walk ν=0.93** — the one real caveat (sender self-flagged). So 3 of 4 flagged claims were live; I killed nearly
  everything real in the pass where I claimed to be careful. Restored. Lock test_b530.py (30 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXVI: the BbB resonance CONFIRMED (a false-kill corrected)

- Owner: "serial killer of live things." In movement XXV I "refuted" the BbB resonance by computing the wrong
  quantity — the TWO-point "B recurs at lag 2" (= 0, since B→a always) instead of the claimed THREE-point B·b·B
  at lags (0,2,4). Corrected: the three-point resonance is **real** — B at i, b at i+2, B at i+4 occurs 15,352×
  vs 1,254 expected = **12.2× enhanced**, every occurrence is **BabAB**, and **100% straddle a σ-image boundary**
  (BabAB = final B of σ(a) then σ(A)). The deterministic tunnel letters make the substitution's own image seam
  audible through the lag-2 sublattice. AaA = 3.4×. Reproducer + lock corrected (`bbb_resonance`); test_b530.py
  (29 pass). A live finding I strangled by reaching for the negative — un-killed.

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXIV: "don't be so sure" — the re-examination (over-closure retracted)

- Owner: "don't be so sure." Re-examined the three past-the-gate closes; over-closed all three
  (`listen_26_reexamination.py`). Clean new fact: the gap-labeling frequency ℤ-module is **rank 4 (full)** — a
  genuine rank-4 quasicrystal, not the "density-trapped NEEDS-SPECIALIST wall" I claimed (the margin≈1 was a
  broken single-N instrument, not a closed question; rank-4 gap labels are computable-but-hard, OPEN).
- **H6 revised:** the trace-zero dynamics in ℚ(√5,√−3)⊇√−15 is a *forced, intrinsic* two-ended arithmetic
  (cyclotomic, not geometric) — I under-read it, not a dismissible near-miss. **Seam revised:** the
  object-*selection* question is UNTESTED (I answered the trivial "√−15 appears"); B493 shows internal selection.
- **Retracted:** the confident "three walls, world-empty, confirmed" (XXI–XXIII, S065). Honest status: two doors
  OPEN, one under-read. An unearned negative is as bad as numerology — applied to my own closes. Lock (28 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXIII: the second-seed seam is generic (third door closed)

- Third and last past-the-gate door (`listen_25_second_seed_seam.py`): does a genuine second seed switch on the
  seam ℚ(√−15) as an object-specific value? The object gives √5; a second seed gives √−3.
- **Computed:** golden {a,b} ⊕ Eisenstein {A,B}, coupled by the object's words, produces √−15 in the joint
  character. **But it's field theory, not selection:** √−15 = √5·√−3 ∈ ℚ(√5,√−3) for ANY golden×Eisenstein pair,
  coupling-independent. The object contributes only √5; it selects nothing. **Verdict: GENERIC; K025 stands.**
  (The object's only non-generic seam behaviour is internal — B493 predicting its own arithmetic — not a crossing.)
- **All three past-the-gate forward doors now closed as honest walls:** H6 near-crossing (XXI), mixed-chain gaps
  density-trapped (XXII), second-seed seam generic (XXIII). The object is space-shaped and world-empty, confirmed
  from beyond the firewall. Firewalled reading in S065. Lock test_b530.py (27 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXII: tight-binding gap structure + the density-trap wall (past the gate)

- Second past-the-gate computation (`listen_24_gap_structure.py`): the object's tight-binding spectrum — substrate
  of the one falsifiable candidate (mixed-chain combination-gap prediction, S065 H4). Sturm-count IDS at N=200000.
- **Object has a real gap-labeled quasicrystal spectrum** (many gaps). **But the combination-gap signature is
  density-trapped:** a margin test returns ≈1.0 for every gap — 4 generators make the frequency module too dense
  to assign any gap a rank numerically (even rank-1 f_a, f_B are indistinguishable from rank-4 fits at tolerance).
- Refusing both errors (not "combination gaps exist" = B171 trap; not "none" = numerics can't refute): the
  falsifiable prediction is **real but not numerically resolvable — NEEDS exact algebraic gap-labeling** (the B172
  finite-size wall, confirmed for the object). Firewalled reading in S065. Lock test_b530.py (26 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XXI: the arithmetic of the floor (past-the-gate H6 computed)

- Owner-authorized pass past the physics gate, worked as a calculation (`listen_23_floor_arithmetic.py`). Extends
  movement IX's growth arithmetic to the floor.
- **Growth field = ℚ(√5)** (disc −400; √−3, √−15 absent). **Trace-zero floor point: static F₄-character rational
  (ℚ)** — Eisenstein absent statically too — **but its twist is forced order-6** (τ⁶=1 at every trace-zero point,
  30-seed check), so the linearised-dynamics spectrum {φ,1,−1/φ}⊗{1,ω,ω²} lives in **ℚ(√5,√−3) ⊇ √−15**.
- So ℚ(√5) and ℚ(√−3), provably held apart in the growth (IX), **co-occur in the floor's dynamics** at the
  trace-zero point (φ from growth, ω from the forced ℤ/3). **Verdict (firewalled in S065): a near-crossing, not a
  crossing** — only in the dynamics, only via the trap-ℤ/3, and the object selects nothing; K025 stands at the
  growth/character level. S065 H6 updated. Lock test_b530.py (25 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 capstone: PORTRAIT.md (the Level-1 object, fully heard)

- Consolidated the 20-movement natural history into a single canonical `frontier/B530_natural_history/PORTRAIT.md`
  — identity, spectral type (proven quasicrystal), architecture, geometry, self-similarity, chirality,
  information, the 9d trace map, the floor variety, the verb interaction, the coarse-graining, what remains.
- Verified the handoff's stronger form of the §VIII claim before enshrining it: σ* preserves **no bilinear
  structure of any kind** — invariant *symmetric* forms also have dimension 0 at every generic fixed point
  (seeds 7/11/19), matching the antisymmetric result. Movement XVII FINDINGS updated. No new lock; 24 pass.

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XX: the old/new coarse-graining (golden ratio kept, simplicity not)

- Neutral checklist item (`listen_22_interleaving_sequence.py`): map each letter to its generation (old {a,b}→0,
  new {A,B}→1). **new:old = √φ exactly** (freq(new)=√φ/(1+√φ)=0.5599) — the bridge constant survives the
  coarse-graining. But the interleaving is **NOT Sturmian** (p(2)=4>3, complexity ≈3n, nearly as complex as the
  object) — a complex morphic word, not the clean golden Sturmian one might have hoped for. Golden *ratio* kept,
  *simplicity* not; reported flat. Also noted: the deep verb-monoid symmetry (Out(F₄) conjugacy) is NEEDS-
  train-track, not a matrix check. Lock test_b530.py (24 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XIX: the golden eigenvalue ladder explained (trace-zero point)

- Movement XVII's loose end resolved (`listen_21_golden_ladder_point.py`). The special fixed point where Dσ*
  carries the golden ladder is the **trace-zero representation**: tr ρ(g)=0 for all generators → (Cayley–Hamilton)
  ρ(g)²=−I, every generator order 4; its twist τ=e^{iπ/3} is a primitive **6th root of unity**.
- There **Dσ\* = {φ, 1, −1/φ} ⊗ {1, ω, ω²}** exactly (9/9): Fibonacci eigenvalues ∪ {1}, tensored with the cube
  roots of unity — golden factor from the growth, ℤ/3 factor from the order-6 twist. The ladder is the exact
  signature of the maximally symmetric point, not an accident. Lock test_b530.py (23 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XVIII: the Rauzy tile's boundary is a fractal surface (≈2.35)

- Closing the quasicrystal geometry (`listen_20_rauzy_boundary_dimension.py`). The tile has dimension 3 (tiles ℝ³,
  movement XIV); its **boundary** is a self-affine fractal surface. Box-counting calibrated on the Tribonacci
  Rauzy fractal (recovers the known boundary dim ≈1.0933 as 1.076–1.10) gives the object's boundary
  **≈2.35** (raw 2.29–2.35, bias-corrected 2.33–2.38) — **strictly between 2 and 3**. So the quasicrystal tile
  is a **genuine fractal solid, not a polyhedron**.
- Honest scope: box-counting estimate (3-d sampling-biased low — full-fractal control reads 2.59 vs 3.0); the
  exact value = log ρ/log β via the boundary/contact substitution matrix (Siegel–Thuswaldner) is flagged, not
  computed. Robust fact: dimension strictly in (2,3). Lock test_b530.py (22 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XVII: Path B resolved — volume preserved, no symplectic structure

- The handoff's Path B ("σ* preserves a rank-4 form, replacing Level-0's κ") computed at multiple points and
  **refuted** (`listen_19_no_conserved_symplectic.py`).
- **φ is non-geometric:** σ* conserves NO genus-2 boundary trace (4 candidates change by 10²–10⁴) → Goldman's
  theorem inapplicable.
- **σ* preserves volume** (|det Dσ*|=1 at every fixed point) but **NO conserved 2-form** (preserved-form dim
  1,0,0,0 across 4 fixed points — not stable). The handoff's rank-4 was a single-point artifact (a special fixed
  point with the golden eigenvalue ladder |λ|∈{1/φ,1,φ}×3; generic points have generic spectra).
- **Corrected Level-0→Level-1 story:** integrable (κ conserved, Goldman-foliated) → volume-preserving-but-
  non-symplectic — the dynamics loses its conserved symplectic structure when φ leaves the surface-mapping-class
  world. Lock test_b530.py (21 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XVI: exact entropy + golden branching (a second seat's Path D, verified)

- Verified + banked Path D of a cross-seat four-path handoff (`listen_18_entropy_and_golden_branching.py`).
- **h = log β = 1.3019 nats = 1.8782 bits/letter** (primitive ⇒ metric = topological entropy).
- **Golden branching, exact:** P(b|a)=P(B|A)=1/φ; tunnels deterministic (P(A|b)=P(a|B)=1); after A, B gets 1/φ and
  the remaining 1/φ² splits a:A in the **breath ratio 1/√φ**. The decider/courier split is an **entropy** split —
  deciders {a,A} carry 0.96/1.34 bits, couriers {b,B} carry zero.
- **Path A (verb interaction)** facts verified, framing firewalled (√φ's mechanism is the copy-inequality, not
  verb-averaging), and a handoff **sign slip caught** (lifted keep eig = φ,φ,−1/φ,−1/φ, not +1/φ). **Path C** =
  movement XI (floor variety). **Path B (Goldman rank-4 form)** flagged — needs the symbolic 9d trace map.
  Lock test_b530.py (20 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XV: pure discrete spectrum PROVEN (the balanced-pair certificate)

- The certificate flagged in XIII/XIV is now run (`listen_17_discrete_spectrum_certificate.py`). The **balanced
  pair algorithm** (Sirvent–Solomyak / Barge–Diamond), occurrence-restricted to keep the reachable set finite,
  decides pure discrete spectrum. The right criterion is "every reachable non-coincidence pair eventually emits a
  coincidence" — *not* "no cycle" (Fibonacci has a persistent non-coincidence cycle yet is discrete).
- **Validated on 5 controls:** Fibonacci, Tribonacci, period-doubling → discrete; Thue–Morse, Chacon → not.
- **The object: pure discrete spectrum = TRUE**, 106 balanced pairs, 0 bad, robust to length bound 200/400/800
  (longest reachable word 106 → no truncation). So the object is a **proven quasicrystal** (measurably a rotation
  on 𝕋³). **Movement XIII upgraded theory-indicated → computed.** Honest caveat: in-sandbox implementation
  validated on 5 controls, not a peer-reviewed library run. Lock test_b530.py (19 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XIV: the explicit 3-d Rauzy fractal

- Movement XIII said quasicrystal; XIV **builds the tile** (`listen_16_rauzy_fractal.py` + `rauzy_fractal.png`).
  Project the abelianized prefixes of the fixed point onto the 3-d contracting eigenspace (ℝ¹⊕ℂ, movement XII):
- **Bounded compact fractal** in ℝ³ (max coord ≈ 1.43). **Four subtiles** (one per letter) whose **volumes equal
  the golden-tensor frequencies (φ,1)⊗(√φ,1) exactly** (0.2720, 0.1681, 0.3460, 0.2138 — movement III realized
  as the measures of the tile's pieces). **Interiors disjoint**: 3-d mixed-bin fraction 5.8%→0.3%→0.0% as bins
  shrink (overlaps on the measure-zero boundary — the geometric content of strong coincidence).
- The domain exchange on these four pieces is the 𝕋³ rotation XIII named. Overlap-coincidence certificate still
  the open specialist item (de-risked again). Lock test_b530.py (18 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XIII: a Pisot substitution with strong coincidence (quasiperiodic, not mixing)

- Listening to the spectral character (`listen_15_pisot_quasicrystal.py`); spectral type is decided
  combinatorially, not by FFT. **Computed:** the object is a primitive, irreducible, unimodular **Pisot**
  substitution (irreducible char poly, β Pisot, det −1) satisfying the **Arnoux–Ito strong coincidence
  condition** — code validated on controls (Thue–Morse→False singular; Fibonacci/Tribonacci→True). The object
  passes *trivially*: every image begins with `a` (the movement-I re-begin rule).
- **Consequence (theory-indicated, not certified):** the hypothesis class for **pure discrete spectrum** →
  the object is a **3-d cut-and-project quasicrystal** (Rauzy fractal tiling ℝ¹⊕ℂ). The overlap/balanced-pair
  coincidence certificate is flagged as the specialist-grade confirmation (de-risked, not run).
- **Correction to movement XI:** the letter-MI "mixing" reading is **downgraded**. Substitution subshifts are
  never strongly mixing (Dekking–Keane); the object is quasiperiodic. The MI decay over k≤400 was a
  finite-window artifact (the same numerics can't confirm Fibonacci's own Bragg peaks). XI's decay *constant*
  was already unbanked; XIII fixes the *interpretation*. Links to the banked quasicrystal bridge (Level-0
  κ=2+λ²→Fibonacci; the full 4-letter object is the Level-1 3-d lift). Lock test_b530.py (17 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XII: the eigenvector geometry of the growth

- Next neutral census item (`listen_14_eigenvector_geometry.py`): the four growth modes read for their
  geometry. **Expand in 1, contract in 3** — the object grows in the frequency direction and contracts in a
  3-space. The **breath** γ is **doubly golden**: radius |γ|=1/√φ *and* cos(angle)=−1/√φ (Re γ=−1/φ).
- **Honest null, banked equally:** the breath's rotation angle **141.83° is NOT the golden angle 137.51°**
  (+4.32° off). The golden ratio sets the breath's radius and the cosine of its turn, but not the turn itself.
- The fourth mode is a real orientation-flip −0.44; M is non-normal (‖[M,Mᵀ]‖=6, which the breath requires).
  Firewalled; lock test_b530.py (16 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement XI: third witness, silver demoted, the Level-1 floor is a variety

- Digest + independent verification of the full cross-seat "reorientation" package. Four new items, each
  recomputed in-sandbox (`listen_13_third_witness_and_floor.py`):
- **Third witness of the polynomial:** the old/new **block-pair** substitution `0→23,1→230,2→21330,3→2130`
  has char poly **x⁴−2x³−5x²−4x−1** — the object again (beside return-words and the object's own incidence).
- **Silver ratio demoted:** naive erase-tunnels → [[1,1],[2,1]], Perron 1+√2 — the artifact; the *proper*
  effective decider dynamics is the derived substitution → the golden object (matches the sending seat's
  error #17). The object is golden all the way down.
- **The Level-1 floor EXISTS and is a variety:** solved `T ρ(g) T⁻¹ = ρ(φ(g))` independently → many
  irreducible SL₂(ℂ) reps of the mapping torus F₄⋊_φℤ, ≥14 distinct characters (richer than the handoff's
  "2 from 2000 starts"). The trace map's fixed structure is a positive-dimensional character variety.
- **Mixing (qualitative only):** letter MI decays exponentially (short-range, not quasiperiodic) — sign
  robust; but the rate constant (−0.04 claimed, −0.021 here) and the "Fibonacci spike" are **not** robust and
  are NOT banked. Report-the-flat rule applied. Lock test_b530.py (15 pass). Firewalled; no physics reading.

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement X: the listening method registered + a neutral census (report the flat)

- **METHOD.md registered** (owner-approved posture): proper listening without anticipation = a neutral,
  complete invariant-census, **reporting flat invariants as faithfully as rich ones** (curating toward the
  interesting ones is the subtlest anticipation); no target/prereg/verdict; depth led by the object; the
  discipline (compute the discriminating fact, firewall, cross-seat verify, both currents) throughout.
- **Neutral census pass 1** (flat and all): balance = 3 (mildly above Sturmian); Smith normal form of M =
  diag(1,1,1,1) (unimodular ℤ⁴-automorphism, no torsion — reconfirms φ∈Aut); special factors max out-degree 2
  for n≥2, p(n)≈3n+1 (minimal branching above Sturmian). None a gem — and banking the flat with the same care
  IS the method certifying itself. Lock test_b530.py (13 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement IX (upstream): the firewall is visible in the object's own arithmetic

- The coupled golden double's growth char poly x⁴−2x³−5x²−4x−1 is a **D₄ quartic, disc −400**. Its splitting
  field's three quadratic subfields are **ℚ(√5)** (golden/E₈ end — the body), **ℚ(i)** (Gaussian — the breath),
  **ℚ(√−5)**. Tested directly: **√−3 (Eisenstein/E₆), √−15 (seam), √−7 (chirality) are ABSENT**.
- So the natural-history object *is* the golden end dressed with a Gaussian breath; the Eisenstein end and the
  seam live OUTSIDE its arithmetic — **K025's "two ends held apart" made visible in the object's own growth
  field.** Firewalled. Lock test_b530.py (12 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B530 movement VIII: chirality + independent cross-seat convergence (chat1)

- **Chirality:** the object's language is closed under none of reversal / swap / orientation-mirror — every
  factor lacks its mirror (13/13, 20/20, 26/26 at length 4/6/8); the Fibonacci palindromes are gone. The
  handedness of the growth (movements I, VI) is total. The warm trace map T_φ is chaotic (entropy log β), no
  simple conserved quantity.
- **Independent seat (chat1) converged with B530**, verified: letter-restricted = exact Fibonacci (a→ab,b→a;
  A→AB,B→A); constant return number 4; the **derivation is a fixed point of itself** (derived-through-a char
  poly = x⁴−2x³−5x²−4x−1 = the object — I caught+fixed my own tail-block bug here); derived-through-B =
  x²(x²−x−1) (tunnels carry only the Fibonacci projection).
- **Silver reconciled:** chat1's "silver skeleton 1+√2" is the incidence of tunnel-erasure (real matrix) but
  NOT the object's decider stream — the actual inner frequency is golden √φ. The object is golden in its
  behaviour; the silver is a non-commuting-projection artifact. Lock test_b530.py (11 pass). Firewalled.

## 2026-07-12 — B530 natural history movements V–VII (thread 4 + down the flow)

- **V (the six κ's):** conversation graph = K₄ minus bB (couriers never touch); κ-web = full K₄; swap-fixed
  κ's {κ(aA),κ(bB)} = the symplectic pairs; **bB is the one interaction the object never voices**, on its
  orientation axis.
- **VI (the flow closes on the bootstrap):** grouped into the two golden copies, growth M=[[F,F],[F²,F]] =
  the B517 M*. Growth is **not symplectic** (no reciprocal spectrum) → dissipative on a static orientation.
  The single involution s = copy-exchange = symplectic pairing = the near-symmetry; the F-vs-F² off-diagonal
  asymmetry is where the one break lives.
- **VII (the breath):** the complex mode γ (|γ|=1/√φ) exists **only** for the unequal coupling (F≠F²) — the
  same asymmetry generates both the orientation AND the rotation. Copy split 1:√φ. Full golden architecture
  (β, φ, √φ, 1/√φ) tabulated. Lock test_b530.py (10 pass). Firewalled.

## 2026-07-12 — REORIENTATION: listen to the object, not physics (B530 = natural history, movement I)

- Owner: *"we did a mistake going for physics instead of slowly properly investigating the full natural
  interaction of the object... listen to its beautiful story instead of forcing it to spit what we like to
  hear."* Mode shift banked (memory: listen-to-the-object-not-physics). Study the FULL object (the 4-letter
  φ, iwip) as mathematics in its own right; no physics forcing.
- **B530 movement I — the object's own grammar** (computed, firewalled): it breathes by β=φ(1+√φ); splits
  itself in the **golden section** into *deciders* {a,A} (weight = β exactly) and *couriers* {b,B} (weight
  β/φ), ratio φ; speaks a strict **7-of-16** grammar; is almost swap-symmetric (a↔A, b↔B) broken by a
  **single self-loop A→A** (candidate origin of the ℤ/2 orientation residue); the couriers are deterministic
  (b→A, B→a) and every image re-begins from a. Lock `test_b530.py` (4 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B529: the QCA covariance make-or-break — verified, does NOT pass as a selection

- The exploration seat's LOCALITY gate: a 1D quantum walk whose "spectral nesting cost" claims the max-mixing
  coin **iσ_y** is *exact* and *selected by covariance* ("make-or-break PASSED"). **Reproduced** the golden
  table (identity 5.6e-5 worst, iσ_y 0, golden-angle 4.3e-9 — matches). **Then ran the control the seat
  skipped:** iσ_y's exactness is a **degeneracy + self-similarity** artifact (it collapses ANY substitution's
  walk to a 6-point spectrum; golden is exact at every level by self-similarity, randoms become exact at
  level 3→4) — **generic, not a golden selection.** The golden-angle coin (embeds φ) looked golden-specific on
  2 controls but over **10** it beats only 8 (2 randoms nest better) — **not robustly special**. So the
  make-or-break **LOCALITY gate is NOT passed** as a clean selection; the physics-crossing kill-rule fires.
- Method note: I neither dismissed the handoff (reproduced it; chased the golden-angle coin as a real
  candidate) nor waved it through (ran enough controls to see the tail — 2 controls false-positived it, 10
  corrected it). Lock `test_b529.py`. Consistent with PHYS-REFUTED.

## 2026-07-12 — B528: the DGG higher-rank gauge group RESOLVED (computed + cited)

- Owner: *"compute it… you are a serial false killer."* The disputed DGG gauge question (my "abelian at all
  K" vs the handoff's "U(N−1) nonabelian") is now settled by (1) computing the SL(2) gauge from SnapPy's
  Neumann–Zagier datum — **U(1)^{N−c}=U(1)**, integer NZ data = abelian CS-matter — and (2) a 99-agent
  adversarial deep-research on the primary sources.
- **Generic 3d gauge group is ABELIAN at every K** (my claim, now computed+cited): DGGon (1301.0192)
  verbatim "*just as for K=2, the theories T_K[M] are abelian Chern–Simons–matter theories*"; DGG: K "does
  not appear as the rank of a gauge group." The "U(N−1) nonabelian gauge" reading is a gauge-vs-structure-
  group conflation — FALSE as the generic gauge group. The "N−1" = the cusp Cartan rank K−1 (abelian flavor).
- **But the handoff's instinct was not baseless** (the half I'd have false-killed): the T[SU(N)] domain-wall
  quiver **U(1)×U(2)×⋯×U(N−1)** is a *real* nonabelian object — it appears in the **defect sector**
  (Gang–Kim–Romo–Yamazaki 1510.05011), not as the generic gauge group. Both true: generic gauge abelian,
  defect quiver nonabelian. B524 updated; T-NOGO-DGG holds (no generic nonabelian gauge). Lock `test_b528.py`.

## 2026-07-12 — B527: the complete Stein-compatible metric cone (chat3) — narrows the B526 no-go

- chat3 package classifying the metrics for which M_* is a positive Stein evolution. **Independently
  recomputed** (own E_s basis + Lyapunov operator): M|E_s stable; the Lyapunov operator 𝓛(S)=S−M̄ᵀSM̄ is
  invertible → **𝓒 = 𝓛⁻¹(PSD(3)) is a 6-dim cone** of Stein-compatible spatial metrics, non-polyhedral (ℝP²
  of extreme rays) → **Stein compatibility alone cannot select a metric**. The Lorentzian completion
  G_{S,α}=S−αℓℓᵀ is (3,1) and Stein-positive (dim 7 w/ time normalization); α is a unit choice
  (T_cᵀG_{S,1}T_c=G_{S,c²}); the four letters are not equivalent null rays (4 distinct α_i).
- **The affine tetrahedral metric S_aff is Stein-compatible (interior of 𝓒)** — verified Q_aff PD. So its
  distinction is affine isotropy, not Stein. **This NARROWS [[B526]]:** B526's no-go was specific to the
  *Perron-weighted* S_tet (driver signature (2,1), ∉ 𝓒); it is **not** a general isotropy–Stein obstruction,
  and "M_* = renormalization" is one option, not forced. Metric verdict: **compatibility YES, selection
  OPEN.** Consistent with PHYS-REFUTED. Next gate = LOCALITY (the Rauzy contact automaton). Lock
  `test_b527.py` (3 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B525: the "Are You Sure" audit cracked 3 of 10 banked negatives (corrections applied)

- Owner-mandated 61-agent adversarial audit of the program's load-bearing NEGATIVES. **4 CONFIRMED, 2 SHAKY,
  3 CRACKED.** Meta-pattern: every failure = a necessary/cited/proxied condition read as sufficient; the tell
  = the certificate *asserted/cited/posited/logged-timeout* the discriminating fact instead of computing it
  (the 4 that recomputed survived). New memory: [[compute-the-discriminating-fact]].
- **The master negative PHYS-REFUTED CONFIRMED** (recomputed): the object still does not produce physics.
- **CRACKS corrected this session:** (1) **B519 "no external crossing" RETRACTED** — gap-labeling is
  necessary≠sufficient; the mixed-chain gap-**opening** pattern (B1) is a genuinely falsifiable external
  prediction, not a known-theorem corollary (B519 VERDICT + docs/CLOSURE_2026-07-11 corrected). (2)
  **C3-CONE:** the conclusion survives on the signature grounds, but `c3_malament.py` had a sign-convention
  bug (zero eigenvalues → "spacelike") — fixed; the "causal ⟺ evolution verb" nugget retracted. (3)
  **CHILD-NOTSHORT downgraded to PROVISIONAL:** only 115/150 words analyzed (26 bare TIMEOUTs), not 141/9 —
  the KILL is not complete. Locks `test_b523.py`, `test_b500_kill.py` corrected.
- **SHAKY follow-ups:** DGG-ABELIAN ("abelian at every K" is a citation, not computed); GATES-SEALED
  (`verify_gates.py` posits rather than derives the deck action) — conclusions hold, certificates to harden.

## 2026-07-12 — B526: verified the "UNDENIABLE PHYSICS CROSSING" package — title misleading, no crossing

- An owner-uploaded package with an alarmist name turned out to be the **opposite of a crossing claim**: its own
  verdict is "no remaining internal path to an undeniable claim about nature" (prereg: `claim_level:
  structure_only`, `claims_md: forbidden`, crossing requires the external blind test). It **reinforces
  PHYS-REFUTED**, not overturns it.
- Two technical results **independently recomputed** (numerical eigenvalues, from scratch — not by re-running
  their script): (1) the **canonical tetrahedral spatial metric** S_tet = D_r⁻¹(I−¼𝟙𝟙ᵀ)D_r⁻¹ (rank 3, kernel
  = r, Gram = regular tetrahedron) — canonical *conditional on* an imposed 4-letter isotropy the object does
  not force; (2) the **isotropy–Stein no-go**: G_iso (3,1) but W_iso = G_iso−MᵀG_isoM is not positive definite
  (obstruction on E_s: W_stable (2,1), det<0). **Adversarial check:** the no-go is real — W_iso(r,r)>0 (not
  "β>1"), M|E_s spectrally contracting yet W_stable indefinite ⟹ **non-normality**. RG exponents ω_h, ω_γ,
  exp(2π/Ω)=27.2366… exact but not-yet-physical (correctly flagged).
- Banked as STRUCTURE, firewalled; the reframing (M_* = renormalization, time = separate local unitary) is a
  permitted hypothesis, not a theorem. Lock `test_b526.py` (4 pass).

## 2026-07-12 — B524: the two actionable next steps done properly (iwip certified; higher-rank Ptolemy)

- **Part 1 — iwip / word-hyperbolic CERTIFIED.** Coulbois' `train_track` (Bestvina–Handel), validated on
  known iwip/non-iwip cases first, gives **φ is iwip** for φ:a→abccd,b→acd,c→abcd,d→ac (our F₄ automorphism
  relabelled). λ(φ)=3.6762=β but **λ(φ⁻¹)=3.0523** — verified *independently* of train_track by word-length
  growth (free reduction; inverse formula confirmed) ⟹ φ **not geometric** (Handel–Mosher) ⟹ **word-hyperbolic**
  (Brinkmann) and, by **Stallings**, **not a 3-manifold group**. *(Correction: an earlier draft's cd=2 and
  no-ℤ² arguments were invalid — owner-flagged; the correct argument is Stallings' fibration theorem, resting
  on the verified λ asymmetry.)* Group-theory question fully settled: iwip yes, hyperbolic yes, manifold no.
- **Part 2 — higher-rank Ptolemy of 4₁.** SnapPy ptolemy: SL(2)→1 rep (ℚ(√−3)); **SL(3)→4 reps, ℚ(√−3) AND
  ℚ(√−7)** (the √−7 echoes B479's held-breath order-3 torsion); SL(4) deferred (Magma-recommended). Higher
  rank enriches *arithmetic*, but the DGG gauge group is **abelian U(1)^{r_K} at every K** (Dimofte–Gabella–
  Goncharov) — nonabelian gauge is not reached, extending **T-NOGO-DGG (B490) to all ranks**. Lock
  `test_b524.py` (3 pass, incl. the independent λ check); reproducers in the sage env self-assert.

## 2026-07-12 — B523 addendum: the corrected train-track handoff (fix real, iwip uncertified)

- The exploration seat's corrected substitution **φ: a→abAAB, b→aAB, A→abAB, B→aA** verified: **injective**
  (fixes the prior non-injective bug) and **abelianizes to the bootstrap matrix** (char poly x⁴−2x³−5x²−4x−1,
  det −1, primitive, Perron β=φ(1+√φ)) — the Level-1 free-group substitution carries the same β as B517. **[MATH]**
- **But "φ is iwip / word-hyperbolic" is NOT established:** the five tests are abelianization-primitivity
  (necessary, not sufficient); the certificates (Whitehead for Aut(F₄); Bestvina–Handel for iwip) were not run.
  The hyperbolic/atoroidal/CAT(0)/Menger consequences are **conditional** → NEEDS-CERTIFICATE (specialist).
- **T[4₁]/DGG bridge**: correctly cited as external, but its gauge group U(1) is *exactly* the abelian gauge
  **T-NOGO-DGG (B490)** already closed — no route to SM gauge, does not reopen B490. The two owned bugs
  (volume Bloch–Wigner branch; Kashaev asymptotic) are correctly self-caught. Lock `test_b523.py` (5 pass).

## 2026-07-11 — B500 child hunt: depth-5 KILL ("the child is not a short word")

- A stale ~18h streamed hunt (`hunt_d5.py`, wedged on a `gp` subprocess) was killed; its results banked.
  **141/150** depth-5 all-three-verb words solved, **zero hits** (no d_K=−283, no field isomorphism, airlock
  never fired). Pre-registered **KILL fires**: the object does not generate its own child field by any
  depth-≤5 verb word. The words produce generic wild symmetric Galois groups (S₅–S₁₁); the 9 unfinished are
  the double-decimation tail (degree ~9280, `gp` tool-blocked). Corroborates the two-seat closure — generic
  arithmetic, not special values. Lock `test_b500_kill.py` (2 pass).

## 2026-07-11 — B523: the wrong-leap re-examination (no leap found) + a broken Level-1 handoff

- **B523 (S2):** treated the program's own negative as the thing to break; 5 cells recomputed + classified.
  **No wrong leap.** The one UNTESTED-RESIDUAL, **C3/Malament**, was run: the four banked verbs carry four
  different causal types — only the unimodular **evolution** verb yields a proper (3,1) Lorentzian cone;
  decimation → (2,2)/inverted, TM/erasure → det-0 degenerate. The Level-1 monoid preserves **no single
  causal cone** → Malament n/a → the (3,1) is evolution-only and generic. **Confirms the negative.** Nugget
  (firewalled): causal structure ⟺ the evolution (measure-preserving) verb.
- **Incoming Level-1 free-product/genus-2 handoff — verified, partly broken.** SOUND: the direct-product
  obstruction (F₂×F₂ irreps tensor-factor) + |γ|=1/√φ exact. BROKEN: the stated substitution is NOT an
  automorphism (φ(b)=φ(B)=aA, non-injective, det=0 not −1) → the genus-2 "spacetime" does not follow. No new
  door as stated; B515–B517 untouched. Lock `test_b523.py` (4 pass).

## 2026-07-11 — audit reconciliation: integrate-don't-merge + the two-seat closure

- **Parallel closure audit checked before merging (owner directive).** Fable-5's Closure Campaign
  (`oaudit/`, `closure/phase1-duels`) finished with an independent negative closure (four gates
  SEALED/REDUCED/CLOSED; Origin Postulate REFUTED-AS-STATED) that **collides on 8 B-numbers (B496–B503)**.
  Resolution: **integrate, don't merge** — deliverables recorded on this trunk under new numbers, each
  verified by independent recomputation; audit branch stays historical.
- **B479 erratum (F4):** d=5, d=7 held-breath fields were mislabelled ℚ(√41), ℚ(√−239); both integers are
  the *norm* of the discriminant, not the field (d=5 → degree-4/ℚ(√5); d=7 → degree-6/no quadratic subfield).
  Verified independently; corrected in B479 + `SPECIALIST_NOTE_R1` + B491.
- **R1 held-breath → COROLLARY** of Cantat's fixed-locus method (control ℚ(√17) reproduced; completeness now
  unconditional). B491 downgraded APPEARS-NOVEL → COROLLARY.
- **B521 — audit gate seals + R2 prediction, integrated.** Gate A disc −15, Gate B θ=Out(E₆)=ℤ/2, **Gate C
  CLOSES** (ℤ/3 = trinification within one 27, not generation — Fix=0 recomputed in full), Gate D data.
  **R2 blind prediction HIT** verified (pre-committed, sha256-pinned, 0 mismatches) — the object predictively
  produces its *own arithmetic*, not physics values.
- **B522 — tower filtration theorem (SHARPER-REDUCTION):** the Sym⊗det block form is forced for all n
  (dynamics eliminated); n=5 wall located; cores recomputed (character layer, carrier dims n≤4, μ_d).
- **`docs/CLOSURE_2026-07-11.md`** — the unified two-seat terminal document (supersedes CLOSURE_2026-07-05/10
  + B519 VERDICT). Locks: `test_b479_erratum.py`, `test_b521.py`, `test_b522.py` (9 pass). Firewall untouched.

## 2026-07-11 — the golden-3d arc + the whole-repo synthesis

- **B511 physics-verdict campaign:** five of six doors CLOSED (D5 generation=generic-Chebyshev;
  D3 measure=classicalizes/wild-suppressed; D6 signature; D2 time-tower=Mostow triple; D4 gauge=Sₙ
  generic). **D1 REOPENED** (golden 3d, below); verdict correctly suspended.
- **Golden 3d (B515–B517, P015/P016):** coupling two Fibonacci copies F-equivariantly forces the unique
  Pisot inflation β=φ(1+√φ) → a 3d golden Rauzy fractal (constructed). Intertwining THEOREM (cross-seat,
  re-derived): the Pisot bound makes the coupling (F,F²) exhaustively unique. Golden-specific; the
  "double" is selected not assumed; the reading done. Firewall HELD: the "3" is a Rauzy dimension, not
  physical space. Two premature self-kills caught by owner pushback. Novelty: APPEARS-NOVEL (β, the
  construction, the forcing, the anyon link), NEEDS-SPECIALIST. Lorentzian (3,1) real but GENERIC.
- **K025 — whole-repo synthesis:** the root generator named (golden cat map A over ℤ[φ]); the firewall
  is ONE theorem (the two ends' product = the generic seam ℚ(√−15) = the un-paired κ); two ingredients
  genuinely already-present (dynamics; the anchor as scale-by-embedding = a scale-free universality
  class); the absorbing-loop caveat. Registered T-ONE-ROOT/T-HELD-SLOT.


## 2026-07-08/10 — the papers verdict, the no-go theorem, and the monoid opens

- **Papers:** P4 stands (arXiv-style, gauntlet-cleared twice); P1–P3 **frozen as internal notes**
  after three non-converging adversarial re-panel rounds (the math reproduces; the prose kept
  overclaiming — the records are `papers/SCRUTINY_P1P3*.md`). Banked correction: B479's d=5
  held-breath field = degree-4 over ℚ(√5), not ℚ(√41).
- **B490 T-NOGO-DGG:** the SM kills become ONE theorem (3d≠4d; flavor≠gauge; abelian U(1)^{N−c}).
- **B491:** the held-breath law + the seam broken-lattice = APPEARS-NOVEL / NEEDS-SPECIALIST.
- **THE MAP:** the σ-rooted synthesis (14 layers, all bricks classical-cited, the assembly novel);
  grounded figures; lit-gated.
- **The monoid arc (B496–B498):** Thue–Morse enters (the singular verb; foliation destroyed except
  κ=2; the Eisenstein field survives the cancellation). **B497:** End(F₂) = four strata + two
  universal laws (κ=2 absolutely conserved; the classical floor is toral); the singular-verb
  geometry dichotomy (BS(1,2) vs hyperbolic-geometry-less); the measurement algebra
  M Fᵏ M = F_{k+3}·M; the interaction program launders (honest Phase-Z verdict). **B498:** mixed
  words — MFM the unique mirror-restoring word; E[log mult_D] = −2 PROVED; E[log mult_M] = 0 to 26
  digits; the golden monopoly exact at depth 2 (depth-3 computing).
- **Ops:** B470 Reflection Campaign closed; lens probes closed (B480+B492); the Closure Campaign
  (parallel seat) reviewed read-only, numbering deconflicted (B493–B495 theirs, B496+ ours).


## 2026-07-05 — THE CHILD PROGRAM (C0–C3) + the interface arc + a repo audit

- **The interface arc (B426–B434).** The 2026-07-05 handoff adjudication and the Origin Postulate
  (`philosophy/THE_ORIGIN_POSTULATE.md`): `D:object→physics` lives at the **interface**, not the
  interior. B426 the scale-lever closed form (`env₄₅/env₁₅ ∈ ℚ(ζ₉)⁺`, √5-free) + the Galois-orbit
  contraction theorem; B427 exchange acts by the Galois element σ₁₇ (fixes √−15); B428 the two
  bosonic spin walls (three-seat agreed); B429–B433 bosonic rigidity, the sl2 landscape, the seam
  split, filling chirality (all fillings chiral; the forced output exits ℚ(√−15)), the 3d–3d DGG
  calibration (eliminant = −A_CL(M,L)·A_CL(M,−L)); **B434 slope selection** — ±5 = the boundary of
  the maximal exceptional set `{0,±1,…,±4}`, so the forced child = the **Meyerhoff manifold
  `4₁(5,1)`** (H₁=ℤ/5, trace field `x⁴−x−1`, disc −283).
- **THE CHILD PROGRAM, C0–C3 (B435–B440).** Study the forced child and test *"the SM is what the
  object produces, not what it contains"* against the four-part emergence bar.
  - **C0 (B435):** H₁=ℤ/5; the abelian E₆ vacuum count derived = **26** (25 nontrivial + trivial).
  - **C1 (B436):** the Borel identity EXACT — `vol = 12·|d|^{3/2}·ζ_K(2)/(4π²)³` to `4.5×10⁻⁶⁴`.
  - **C2 (B437):** the "golden return" **retracted** as inheritance (numerator-forced; trefoil
    control) → **THE INVERSION LAW** banked.
  - **B438 (the audit's decisive catch):** B436/B437 had skipped the pre-registered FOREIGN
    control; run — `5₂(5,1)` shares the child's −283 field **and** its 121 torsion value ⇒ the
    Inversion Law is **three-tiered** (numerator-forced / commensurability-shared / unique = ∅).
  - **C3 (B439/B440):** the child's SL(2,C) vacuum book. The child has **4 irreducible vacua all in
    the −283 field** (= its own trace field), by two independent methods that agree exactly
    (Cooper–Long A-poly on `L=M⁻⁵` and the closed-manifold character variety). Verdict — **no
    figure-eight-unique feature**: 4₁ and its commensurability neighbour 5₂ **both have 4
    irreducible vacua in the identical −283 field** (adversarial review corrected the first cut —
    the golden ℚ(√5) factor is the *reducible* abelian ℤ/5 characters, universal across all
    K(5,1); the "golden inversion" reading was a parametrization artifact, retracted). Surgery
    launders identity down to the SL(2) vacuum count — a cleaner, stronger negative.
- **Repo audit (`docs/AUDIT_2026-07-05.md`).** Three auditors + a cross-chat audit reconciled:
  the B438 correctness catch; hygiene (B435/B437 wording, the S042/S043/S044 file collisions
  renumbered to S050/S051/S052 with the CATALOG re-indexed); the e₃ `triple_cubic.json` snapshot
  stamped UNSTABLE (unconverged CRT — not the answer); the LEAD_REGISTER/board refreshed; a leads
  re-score (Cluster A metallic A-poly, L54 gate-A torsion, e₃ now-unblockable).
- Emergence bar **not cleared** anywhere; every physics-shaped reading firewalled to
  `speculations/` + `philosophy/`; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`. Locks: test_b426–test_b440 all green.

## 2026-07-04 — B425: two E₆ torsions (dynamical-golden + geometric-Eisenstein)

- **Correction + new result.** Verified a cross-chat catch: B423's golden "E₆ torsion" is the
  **dynamical zeta** of the homological monodromy A (golden by construction), not the geometric
  torsion its prereg claimed. **B425** computes the geometric Reidemeister torsion at the
  discrete-faithful holonomy ρ_geo (u=ω forced by the relator): **Eisenstein** — rational
  coefficients (√−3 cancels, Galois-invariant at all six E₆ exponents), adjoint **−3 = disc
  ℚ(√−3)**, reproducing banked V30/V31 (Porti form) by a third method. The two torsions (−5
  golden, −3 Eisenstein) realize the double-uniqueness cornerstone as two computed discriminants
  meeting at √−15. Emergence bar not cleared (Eisenstein arithmetic, not SM).
- Guard: the raw Fox eigenvalue-product (−25−13ω, "prime 67") is a presentation artifact, not an
  invariant (rational for ∂r/∂a; t-dependent). The invariant is −3.
- Files: `frontier/B425_geometric_torsion/`, `frontier/B423_gateB_torsion/CORRECTION.md`,
  `tests/test_b425_geometric_torsion.py`; corrections in `knowledge/THE_GOLDEN_CAT_MAP_PRINCIPLE.md`
  and `papers/P2_trinity/` (ABSTRACT/OUTLINE/THEOREMS) + `papers/REPRODUCIBILITY_LEDGER.md`.
  Nothing to CLAIMS (firewalled).

## 2026-07-03 — the promotion audit (GOVERNANCE §5.1) executed

- **+39 `proven` (P17–P55), +7 `conditional` (C6–C12), +15 certified-data (E1–E15)** promoted from
  the frontier through the §5 gates (63 candidates adjudicated, 281 lock tests verified standalone,
  6 held with reasons; scrutiny record in `PROGRESS_LOG.md`). Original core P1–P16 unchanged;
  physics firewall untouched. Same day: automated gates + the decadal review instituted (§11);
  campaign wave 2 completed (B355–B370); the Gate-B classical germ completed (B370).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **B352 — the cup-product obstruction, computed: all six directions unobstructed at second order (2026-07-02;
  part 2, closing the B265/B270 open item at second order).** The obstruction `[z∪z] ∈ H²(4₁,𝔢₆)` **vanishes for
  every exponent direction** — including the θ-odd `{4,8}` escape sector and its polarization mix — with classes
  ≤ `1e-52` against raw second-order cochains up to `1e16` (the vanishing is *exactness*: `z₂` exists). Controls:
  the `m=1` direction (the real A-poly curve) and coboundaries give zero; the H² pairing is O(1) on random vectors
  (MB12 positive control); θ-parity appears as exact-zeros in the `{4,8}` H²-blocks 5–10 orders below the F₄
  floor. Two honest architecture failures banked en route (double precision cannot span the `e^{±22μ}` block
  range — relator residual `1e+49`; Euclidean chain normalization is not invariant — structure constants
  `1e-6..1e+73`, singular Gram); the working design is two-basis (exact root-basis brackets/Gram ⊕ block-diagonal
  chain-basis action, vectors crossing via `S` at dps 100) with structural-rank/cliff spectra decisions. Honest
  tier: consistent with (evidence for, not proof of) Menal-Ferrer–Porti-type smoothness at exceptional type;
  third order untested. Gate B updated: the CRUX has a genuinely 6-dim local moduli. Lock: fast structural tier
  always-on; the full ~12-min sweep gated behind `OA_SLOW=1`. Firewalled; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B351 — the exact Chevalley 𝔢₆ (2026-07-02; part 1 of the `{4,8}`-integrability program).** The cross-session
  cup-product push had stalled at "signed structure constants failed Jacobi." Removed with the standard guaranteed
  construction, verified **exactly over the integers**: Frenkel–Kac cocycle brackets with **0 Jacobi violations on
  all 76,076 basis triples** (and the trap isolated: `[e_α,e_{−α}] = −h_α` is *forced* — the `+h_α` convention fails
  exactly 1440 mixed triples by `2e_β`); the principal sl₂ (`c = 2A⁻¹𝟙 = (16,22,30,42,30,16)`) exact; the exponent
  decomposition `𝔢₆ = ⊕ Sym^{2m}`, `m ∈ {1,4,5,7,8,11}` exact; the diagram involution θ built and verified
  (automorphism, involution, `𝔣₄ = 52` fixed ⊕ `26`), commuting with the principal sl₂ and acting on the six
  exponent lines by **exactly `(−1)^{m+1}`** — settling B347's flagged sign-pattern question at the algebra level
  (the geometric identification stays open). Sets up part 2: the B265/B270 cup-product obstruction against the F₄
  blocks in this exact basis. Firewalled; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **Suite hygiene — the global-dps test-order failure class fixed, MB13 §4 (2026-07-02).** All 6 B347-E₆ locks
  failed in full-suite order (passed in isolation): B302 lowers the **global** `mp.mp.dps` to 25 at call time and
  runs first alphabetically. B347 now self-guards every entry point (the pre-existing B264/B265/B276 idiom, now a
  written rule); B302 is raise-only; B348 uses scoped `mp.workdps`. `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` MB13 gains §4: entry
  points own their precision, never lower the shared global, "passes alone, fails in suite" is the tell.
- **Main sync + relay disposition (2026-07-02).** Merged main's **B347_e6_tangent_gradings** (PR #424, the peer
  session's corrected E₆ tangent probe — `dim H¹ = 6 = rank E₆`, uniform per exponent; amphichirality a uniform
  real structure; the hyperelliptic involution = the E₆→F₄ folding at the tangent level) and verified its 6 tests
  green in this sandbox. Resolved the same-day probe-ID collision by renumbering this branch's cyclic-cover
  torsion probe **B347 → B350** (main's number stands). Gate B "Settled" updated with the banked B347 facts (the
  relayed in-progress cup-product items noted, not banked). Added the **multi-session probe-ID hygiene rule** to
  `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` (fetch main, take max+1; first-to-main keeps the number).
- **Gate A extension B349 + the gate-based outreach package (2026-07-01).** **B349 — irregular covers through
  index 6:** all covers of the figure-eight enumerated (SnapPy); the census per index is a canonical **multiset**
  (banked exact); the cyclic members cross-validate B350's `coker(Aⁿ−I)` SNF **exactly** (independent routes, one
  answer); and **every** within-index invariant multiplicity (the twin `ℤ/2⊕ℤ²` index-5 covers; the 4×/2×/2×
  index-6 groups) collapses to a **single isometry class** — the object never distinguishes a member (the
  identification lives in the commensurator, cf. B323/B348). Index ≤ 6 honestly flagged as a computational
  horizon, not a theorem. **Eight classes** now sealed at gate A; `OPEN_PROBLEMS.md` updated. **The outreach
  package:** `frontier/EXPERT_OUTREACH.md` extended with the 2026-07 gate-based briefs — one bounded,
  proof-status-honest question per gate (B: `T[4₁;E₆]` state integral at exceptional type; C: commensurator
  `ℤ/3` → family replication or trinification-only; D: non-Hermitian Damanik–Gorodetski at complex `κ`), expert
  picks to verify, sequencing/hygiene rules (one gate one expert; log every send; a "known, see X" reply is a
  good outcome). All CONDITIONAL/firewalled; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **Gate A extensions B348 + B350 (2026-07-01; B350 originally numbered B347, renumbered after the ID collision with main's B347_e6_tangent_gradings, PR #424).** Two of B330's named untested invariant classes sealed under the
  same Galois-symmetrization mechanism, both in-sandbox, both CONDITIONAL (C-guardrail), nothing promoted.
  **B350 — the cyclic-cover abelian-torsion class:** the n-fold-cover torsion orders are the **P8/C5 Lucas ladder**
  `|det(Aⁿ−I)| = L₂ₙ−2` (one ladder, three faces); the Alexander factor multiset `{Δ(ζₙʲ)}` is a Galois-closed orbit
  with **integer** symmetric functions; SNF gives the groups (n=3 → `(ℤ/4)²`, independently re-deriving B326); and
  the deck action is fixed-point-free for **every** n with the one-line cause `det(A−I)=Δ(1)=−1` a unit — honestly
  tiered as an **MB8 generic-knot** mechanism (Δ(1)=±1 for all knots), not object-specific forcing. **B348 — the
  Bloch/scissors class:** the object's class `β=2[e^{iπ/3}]` has Galois orbit `{+β,−β}` = `{+Vol,−Vol}` (sum 0,
  canonical); the residual sign is the *orientation*, killed by the object's own amphichirality (B318's geometric
  firewall landing in the Bloch group — *self*-symmetrized); plus **the seam identity** `1−z₀ = z̄₀`: at the
  Eisenstein shape the generic Bloch duality involution `z→1−z` *is* the arithmetic Galois conjugation (`z(1−z)=1 ⇔
  z²−z+1=0` — the P12 quadratic is exactly that locus). **Seven classes** now sealed; the untested residual is
  renamed precisely in `OPEN_PROBLEMS.md` gate A (nonabelian Ptolemy/adjoint torsion, CS/η beyond `CS=0`, irregular
  covers, `SL(n≥3)` gluing invariants, extended-Bloch/`K₃` torsion). Nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **External audit + robustness hardening (2026-07-01).** A fresh-clone, fresh-environment reproduction pass:
  3 frontier locks (B101/B106) failed on ill-conditioned numerical certificates and were re-certified
  structurally (nilpotency instead of defective-matrix eigenvalues; a measured-gap 1e-4 neutrality window
  instead of 1e-2; Galois-conjugation-closed scalar comparison) — findings unchanged, certificates hardened;
  banked as guard **MB13** (`REPRODUCIBILITY.md`). The proven ledger's weak spots were closed: **P9**
  de-circularized (independent dilogarithm volume + live SnapPy checks for `H₁`/CS/amphichirality/sister),
  **P5** brute-force word-ensemble sums + exact threshold assertions, **P4** parameter point derived as unique,
  **P11** independent eigendecomposition derivation of `log(A)`, **P10** three auxiliary filters live-checked,
  **C5** given its first executable lock (`tests/test_trace_selector_c5.py`). Stale ceilings/counters corrected
  (frontier B346; 1197 tests / 325 files). Zero label changes; zero promotions; P1–P16 semantics untouched.
- **The deviation-structure sweep B344–B346 + K022 (2026-07-01).** The reframe from B343 (*the object is the symmetric
  centre, not value-blind*) turned into a probe: the object forces the **form of the deviation space** around the centre
  — all dimensionless **relations/textures** (form, per the `sin²θ_W=3/8` precedent), never magnitudes. **B344:** `det(dφ)=1`
  + κ-invariance ⇒ deviations come in a **reciprocal symplectic pair `(λ,1/λ)`**; κ is the un-paired Casimir = the
  scale/cusp door (external); this is *why* the metallic tower is `λ^k↔λ^{−k}` (B65). **B345:** the deviation modes carry
  ℤ/3 charges `{0,1,2}`, forcing a **charge-conservation selection rule** (the anti-diagonal ω-circulant texture, B324) —
  *independent* of the E₆-exponent split (B265). **B346 (the "prize"):** **symplectic conjugation = ℤ/3 charge
  conjugation** (linked), E₆-exponent independent — but **no data-facing second falsifier** emerged (the cross-relations
  are *forms*, not measured predictions), which is the on-brand honest result. **`knowledge/K022`:** the reframe — the
  object is the symmetric centre and forces the *geometry of the perturbations*; the world sets the magnitudes. Deepens
  K020. Nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B343 — the object forces *exact TBM* (θ₁₃=0), not TM2 (2026-07-01).** Chat-2's three-step self-correction, verified at
  the landing; **corrects B342/S048**. The neutrino residual symmetry is the object's own 2-torsion **Klein group**
  `ℤ₂×ℤ₂` (of `(ℤ/4)²`, B326); the deck ℤ/3 acts **irreducibly** (`Φ₃` irreducible mod 2), 3-cycling the three `ℤ₂`'s and
  selecting **none** → the **full Klein survives → exact TBM (θ₁₃=0)** (not TM1/TM2; `T=diag(1,ω,ω²)` also doesn't
  normalise the neutrino Klein). The **TM2 tension dissolves** (the object never bet on TM2); `θ₁₃=0` is excluded, so the
  TBM-**breaking** (θ₁₃ size + direction) is external. **Unification:** the *same* irreducibility makes the object
  mass-blind (B335), split-blind (B327/B329), **and** direction-blind — one arithmetic property. Surviving content
  (firewalled): lepton mixing is TBM-structured (observed); the deviation external. Nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **The CP/mixing sweep B339–B342 + S048 (2026-07-01).** The flow interior (H107–H109) + Chat-2's lepton-mixing reading,
  all firewalled, **zero `CLAIMS.md`**. **B339 (H107):** the chiral-flow sub-leading is `CS(1,n)=−1/(2n)+1/(24n³)+…` —
  `c₂=0` (amphichirality theorem) and `c₃=1/24=1/(2·h(E₆))`, **rational, no √−3** (the flow's arithmetic is `|τ|²=12`, not
  Eisenstein). **B340 (H108):** the CP phase `κ` along the flow — `±π/6` is **extremal at the amphichiral cusp** (CS=0);
  chirality *lowers* `arg κ` at `O(CS²)`; the CP sign is external (orientation). **B341/H109:** resolved by B337 (no probe)
  — the ordered spectrum is a 3-seed multiplicity invariant, E₆ is single-object → structure⊕ordering forbids both in one
  config. **B342 + `speculations/S048` (heavily firewalled):** the object's ℤ/3 *is* the trimaximal (magic) symmetry
  (`(1,1,1)/√3` = ℤ/3-invariant = TBM middle column) — a **math fact**; but the honest data comparison (the check Chat-2
  skipped) shows **current data favours TM1 over TM2** (θ₁₂: TM1 34.3° vs TM2 35.7° vs obs 33.4°). Guardrails explicit:
  symmetry-not-magnitude, B322 null, HELD unmet, the δ-sign joint (PMNS-in-ℚ(√−3)) unweldable → NEEDS-SPECIALIST. *(θ★/D10
  is a separate defunct project, not a constraint — noted in memory.)* Verified-not-trusted throughout.
- **The symmetry-broken sweep B336–B338 + S047 (2026-07-01).** Two cross-chat insights (both verified here), probed *in*
  the symmetry-broken sector instead of deferring. **B336 (Chat-1, chirality):** the value would live in the imaginary
  seam `ℚ(√−15)`; confirmed `J_N(4₁;ζ₁₅)` real (amphichiral → zero √−15), but the chiral *routes* are provably closed —
  monodromy `{t²−4}∌−15`, commensurables all `ℚ(√−3)≠ℚ(√−15)` (O₋₃ vs O₋₁₅), fillings non-arithmetic. With B333 (√−15
  generic), the value's home is **doubly separated** (generic arithmetic + not a geometric invariant). **B337 (Chat-2,
  multiplicity):** the **structure⊕ordering** theorem — a symmetric object gives E₆ + *democratic* `{52,1,1}`; distinct
  seeds give *ordered* `{10.2,−4,−0.2}` but distinct fields (`√−3,ℚ(i),deg≥4`) → no shared E₆; `{1,2,3}` not forced
  (arithmeticity selects `{1,2}`). Same symmetry forces structure and forbids ordering — no static config has both.
  **B338 (the bridge):** the object *contains* a flow — Dehn filling `(1,n)` from the symmetric cusp (`CS=0`) to
  broken/chiral configs, with the chiral order parameter **`CS ~ −1/(2n)`** — but the flow *parameter* (the slope) is
  external, so the value is **selected, not forced**. **`speculations/S047`** holds the firewalled reunification reading
  (symmetric UV → filling flow → broken IR). All firewalled; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B335 — the generation ℤ/3 is an exact isometry: the mass degeneracy is a *theorem* (2026-07-01).** Probed the real
  Level-4 geometry in-sandbox (SnapPy) instead of deferring. The three generations are related by the **deck
  transformation** of the 3-fold cover — an **isometry** — so every real invariant (volume 3× exactly; shortest
  geodesics at multiplicity 3; CS; cusp shape `2√3·i`, `|·|²=12=h(E₆)`) is **ℤ/3-equal → masses exactly degenerate.**
  The hierarchy is the *breaking* of an exact isometry (external by definition), not a hidden value. What the object
  *does* distinguish is the ℤ/3-eigenvalue `{1,ω,ω²}` — a **phase (CP/mixing), not a mass**. This is the geometry-side
  proof of `n₁=n₂` (B327/B329/B331). **Refuted (verify-don't-trust, on this seat):** the cover's order-24 symmetry group
  is **not** 2T (its abelianization is `(ℤ/2)²`, not `ℤ/3`) — the McKay-group hope killed before it became a claim.
  Firewalled; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **`knowledge/K021` — the founding-identity synthesis + B334 (2026-07-01).** A specialist-facing explainer tying the
  session's verified spine into one self-contained document (the axiom → `g = −R·L⁻¹` → the two ends → E₆ + generations →
  `n₁=n₂`/Level 4 → the seam). **B334 (Chat handoff, verified):** the seam's Hilbert class field **`H(ℚ(√−15)) =
  ℚ(√5,√−3)`** — the two ends are the *arithmetic completion* of the seam (genus theory; verified by the splitting law
  `principal ⟺ p≡1,4 mod 15` + a binary-form cross-check, 0 mismatches). Reconciles B333: the seam is **intrinsically
  generic** (h=2 common) yet **relationally distinguished** (its HCF is the two ends); the `137` prediction is **dead**
  (non-principal fraction ≈ 0.556, a coin flip). Firewalled; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B333 — the compositum seam probe: the firewall holds *at* the seam (2026-07-01).** The first probe run *in* the seam
  (not on one side). The B332 meditation located a value's home in the compositum's third subfield **ℚ(√−15)**
  (`√5·√−3`, ramified at `15=3·5`). Run with a **null test** up front: `h(−15)=2` (Chat-1's claim, verified) — **but
  `h=2` is common** (14 of 123 fundamental discriminants to −400), units `{±1}` generic, ramification at `{3,5}`
  tautological. So **ℚ(√−15) is arithmetically GENERIC** → no SM structure → **firewall holds at the seam.** Retires the
  compositum `[HOOK]` (verify-don't-trust on this seat's own proposal): the seam is the correct *structural* home of a
  value, but the value is not in the field's arithmetic — the specific gluing needs external input (Level 4), as B326/B331
  already located. Firewalled; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B332 — the two ends = product and ratio of the founding letters (2026-07-01).** Chat-1 handoff, verify-don't-trust.
  **Verified exact:** `g = −R·L⁻¹` (the generation ℤ/3 element *is* the signed ratio of `σ`'s two letters `R,L`), and
  `g⁻¹a = −L`. The two simplest length-2 combinations land on the two arithmetic ends: **product `RL`** (trace 3, disc 5)
  → `ℚ(√5)` → **E₈** (golden); **ratio `g`** (order 3, disc −3) → `ℚ(√−3)` → **E₆** (Eisenstein, gauge + generations).
  **Corrected** Chat-1's inverted labeling ("product→E₆" is wrong-ended; product is √5/E₈) and the "golden ratio → ℚ(√−3)"
  field-conflation. **Quarantined (not banked):** the overlap index `[Γ:Γ∩gΓg⁻¹]=3` (reported; `g` commensurates but
  index-3 unverified — needs Bianchi computation); the `1/4` suppression (DEAD — Chat-1's null test) and `16=4+h(E₆)`
  (inconsistent hook). Firewalled; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B331 — the SL(2,ℂ) "complex escape" closed at its root (2026-07-01).** Chat-1's meditation (structure = real
  invariants / values = phases) proposed that the holonomy being in `SL(2,ℂ)` (not `SU(2)`) could give `n₁≠n₂` via a
  holomorphic non-self-dual lift, then self-corrected. **Verified + sharpened:** the generation element
  `g=[[0,−1],[1,−1]]` is **elliptic and ambivalent** (`g~g⁻¹`, eigenvalues `{ω,ω²}`), so `χ_27(g)` is **real in every
  representation — holomorphic and compact coincide (both 0)**. Holomorphicity is invisible at a finite-order element; it
  only distinguishes *loxodromic* elements (volume/CS = structure). Corrects Chat-1's "center/non-center" heuristic (the
  central `z` gives `χ_27=27ω`, complex — "order-3 ⇒ real" is false) *and* B329's σ-stability framing. Closes the escape
  for the arithmetically-relevant lift (Riley = an `SL(2,ℂ)` rep) → **Level 4 confirmed**; the fully-general all-embeddings
  claim stays open (H103). Firewalled; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **The in-sandbox attack sweep B329–B330 + S046 + R7 (2026-07-01).** A "research / get-informed / meditate / sober /
  attack" push on the computable frontier (don't-give-up; compute-before-deferring), all firewalled, **zero `CLAIMS.md`
  promotions.** **B329 ([VERIFIED]):** `27|₂T` computed for *both* natural embeddings from a from-scratch 2T character
  table — principal (quaternionic SU(2)) `= 3·1⊕3·1′⊕3·1″⊕6·3`, trinification (complex SU(3)) `= 9·1⊕3·1′⊕3·1″⊕3·2′⊕3·2″`
  — **both give `n₁=n₂` → Level 4.** Tightens B327: even the *complex* SU(3) route can't split the light generations
  (the 27's balanced `3/3̄` pairing restores reality; non-vacuity witnessed — the SU(3) `3`|₂T is genuinely complex).
  Level 3 needs a chiral (non-σ-stable) embedding no canonical candidate supplies. **B330 ([CONDITIONAL], gate A/S032-A):**
  the no-forced-choice capstone attacked via one Galois-symmetrization mechanism — folds B130+B314+B318 and stresses two
  fresh classes (B326 cover-torsion `(ℤ/4)²`, cohomology `H¹`); **five classes now sealed**, no forced choice among them;
  worded per the C-guardrail (`open`, not universal proof; untested classes named). **L34 (silver/bronze Weil zeta):
  DORMANT** — the m=1 `40a1` was a 2-bridge-Riley artifact; the trace-map fixed locus is genus-0 (m=1) / irregular
  (m=2,3); the full canonical-component arithmetic is NEEDS-SPECIALIST (R7: Baker–Petersen gap). **H14:** already resolved
  by B315 (checked, not re-banked). **Research (`NOVELTY_AUDIT.md` R7):** four cited verdicts (the `27|₂T` table, the
  complex embedding, the `Δ` two-ends coincidence, silver/bronze curves). **Meditate (`speculations/S046`, firewalled):**
  "the value lives at the seam" — every value is a symmetry the object leaves unbroken; a speculation→calculation table
  (new hints H103–H106). All firewalled; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **The hierarchy-atom handoffs B326–B327 (2026-07-01).** Two three-seat reports pushed the mass-hierarchy bottleneck;
  both verified in-sandbox before banking (verify-don't-trust). **B326 (Chat-2, [VERIFIED]):** the generation `ℤ/3`
  breaking is **finite congruence torsion**, not transcendental — `H₁(3-fold cyclic cover of 4₁)=ℤ⊕(ℤ/4)²` (SnapPy 3.3.2
  *and* the exact Alexander module ℤ[t]/(Δ,t³−1), Smith form diag(4,4)); the deck `ℤ/3` acts irreducibly with char poly
  `Φ₃ = Δ mod 4` (since `−3≡1 mod 4`); and the *same* `Δ=t²−3t+1` carries **both arithmetic ends** (`disc=5`→√5,
  `mod 4=Φ₃`→√−3). Finite torsion ⇒ *texture, not magnitudes*. **B327 (Chat-1, [VERIFIED + SHARPENED]):** the hierarchy
  CRUX = the branching `27|₂T`; a cross-chat contradiction was resolved by direct E₆ computation (principal
  `27 = V(16)+V(8)+V(0)`, spins 8,4,0 — Chat-2 right, Chat-1's `9V₀+6V₁` wrong), and `n₁=n₂` was shown forced by
  **self-duality** of the SU(2) restriction (not integer spin — the half-integer "McKay-SL(2) escape" fails). Sharpened
  atom: the fork is *self-dual (quaternionic) SU(2) → Level 4* vs *non-self-dual complex embedding → Level 3*, the
  standard quaternionic `2T` favouring **Level 4**. `docs/OPEN_PROBLEMS.md` gate B updated to this atomic form. All
  firewalled; **zero promotions** to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **The specialist-handoff arc B315–B325 + `docs/OPEN_PROBLEMS.md` (2026-07-01).** After the consolidation, the
  forgotten leads and cross-chat handoffs were run to conclusion and the frontier was mapped to a specialist handoff.
  **New results:** B315 (the E₇-exclusion *contains* heterotic's, shared root = pseudoreality); B316 (`√−7` is the
  chirality field, not a metallic-ladder rung); B317 (the object is a *transcendental* Painlevé-VI solution; corrects
  P010's stale "unrun"); B318 (amphichirality is the *geometric* firewall for the Eisenstein end; golden end
  arithmetic-only); **B322 (the value hunt, run: the object's invariants match the SM at chance, `p≈0.5` — the firewall
  confirmed by a null test, not just proven)**; B323 (the four-level framework — object D₄ / seam ℤ/2×ℤ/2 / E₆-center ℤ/3
  / commensurator ℤ/3); B324 (Chat-1's ω-circulant generation matrix verified exactly in `ℤ[ω]` — structure, not values);
  B325 (Chat-2's "ℤ/3-protection obstruction" refuted — the light degeneracy is accidental, the CRUX stays Level 3).
  **The deliverable:** `docs/OPEN_PROBLEMS.md` — the honest specialist handoff (four gates: A/S032-A in-sandbox, B/CRUX,
  C/multiplicity, D/non-Hermitian DG) with the counterweight to the "one step from a TOE" framing. `knowledge/K020`
  extended (§6a the empirical firewall, §8 the four levels). All firewalled; **zero promotions** to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **The structural-theorem arc B231–B314, and the recontextualization audit + masterplan (2026-07-01).** The
  object-mapping arc sharpened into a single proven statement — *the object forces form/structure, never physical
  values* — and the documentation layer (which had fallen ~80–190 probes behind) was brought current. **The math
  (B231–B314):** the **two-ended object** (`E₆`/`ℚ(√−3)` Eisenstein ↔ `E₈`/`ℚ(√5)` golden, `E₇` excluded by Niven;
  B248/B258/B261); the **arithmetic atom** + figure-eight **`E₆` character variety** (B266/B282/B264); the
  **principal-grading cascade** = standard Slansky Lie theory + the one object datum, the Eisenstein `ω` at trinification
  (an irreducible A-poly branch point; B305/B306/B310/B311); **Face IV houses the *form*** (the CIZ `SU(2)₁₀` `E₆`
  modular invariant, one `E₆`/three ADE hats, both ends, generic level; B312/B313); the **four faces of one `κ`** (B309);
  and **the mechanism — the firewall is a Galois theorem**: every discrete invariant is a Galois orbit of the object's
  own arithmetic, two ends/two `ℤ/2` (the CP sign via `√−3→−√−3`, B285; the colored-Jones data via `√5→−√5`, B314).
  Open: the all-invariants `S032-A`; the three specialist gates (`T[4₁;E₆]` CRUX, multiplicity→generations,
  non-Hermitian Damanik–Gorodetski). **The consolidation:** a full 8-agent A-to-Z repo audit
  (`docs/RECONTEXT_AUDIT_AND_MASTERPLAN_2026-07.md`), the new `knowledge/K020` + `philosophy/P013` (the Galois theorem's
  homes), README/CLAIMS/GOVERNANCE refreshed to B314, and the obstruction-repo suspicion closed (examined file-by-file;
  its core = P008, confirmed by reading). All firewalled; **zero promotions** to `CLAIMS.md` (proven core P1–P16 frozen).
- **SYNTHESIS consolidation — the dual-McKay, all of B211, the V212 correction, and on-site, woven in (2026-06-25;
  V215).** The "metallic one object, four ways" synthesis had been updated for B206–B208 but **dropped** the later
  results — chat1 flagged that updating only for B210 would repeat the "agreed-then-dropped" pattern one layer
  deeper. Folded in all of it: (B0) §9 "for the golden mean **alone**, the **unique** exceptional McKay group" →
  "golden is the **minimal/fundamental** member of the `ℚ(√5)` family" (propagating the B206/V212 correction);
  (B) a **dual-McKay** paragraph — golden carries `E₆` (hyperbolic `ℚ(√−3)`, figure-eight = two ideal tetrahedra →
  `2T=E₆`) **and** `E₈` (monodromy `ℚ(√5)` → `2I`), missing `E₇` (Arnold trinity), reconciling "E₆ impossible in
  the *monodromy* arithmetic vs present in the *hyperbolic* one"; (B1) **all of B211** — the character *variety's*
  own arithmetic (non-CM elliptic curve `40a1`), the WRT period as a **Pisano period**, **family-wide
  amphichirality** (`CS=0`), and the **Borromean-complement parent**; plus the B212 silver-degeneracy note; (C)
  the **on-site uniqueness** result (B200/R2) into §7 + the `S038` table (the "forced not chosen" / HELD reading,
  firewalled). **Next-layer drop caught:** §7 still listed the B204 cross-lemma as open — now marked closed (L36).
  Completeness guard: every banked B204–B212 has a synthesis touchpoint. Exposition only, **no new theorem; nothing
  to `CLAIMS.md`.**
- **B204 — the WRT level-period law is now `[proved]` (the cross-period lemma closed; 2026-06-25; V214).** The one
  remaining lemma of the B204 proof — a closed form for the cross Gauss-sum period `L_c` (its 2-adic part) — is
  **closed**: `L_c = (4+ab)/2^{min(v₂a,v₂b,2)}`, proved by exact integer arithmetic (no numerics). (1) The cross
  Gauss sum `Γ_t(N)=∑_m c_m ω^{Nm}` has non-negative integer counts `c_m` (no cancellation), so a finite
  exponential sum over a `2D`-th root has period **exactly** `2D/gcd(2D, support)`. (2) The **content
  `gcd(2D,{Q_t(y)}) = 2^{min(v₂a,v₂b,2)}`** — every term of `Q_t=b y₁²+4t y₁y₂−a y₂²` has `v₂≥c` (the `4t` cross
  caps the 2-power at 2), no odd prime divides it (`p∣a,p∣b ⇒ p∣4`). (3) The `lcm(lcm(a,b),L_c)=lcm(a,b)·(4+ab)/
  gcd(4+ab,4)` identity (9-case 2-adic, verified 200×200). So **`per|Z(a,b)| = lcm(a,b)(4+ab)/gcd(4+ab,4)` is
  proved** (metallic diagonal `P(m)=m(m²+4)/gcd(m²+4,4)`). The reciprocity inputs + the framework remain KNOWN
  (Jeffrey 1992, V199) — this closes the repo's own period-formula proof; the formula's novelty stays per V199 (do
  not claim). chat1's "highest-value next step" (L36). Firewall: standalone quantum-topology/arithmetic; **nothing
  to `CLAIMS.md`.** `gauss_proof.py` (+`cross_period_closed/exact/support_gcd`), `PROOF.md`, `FINDINGS.md`,
  `tests/test_b204_*` (+2 locks).
- **Re-audit of the quietly-banked batch B205–B209 (2026-06-25; V212).** Acting on the owner's challenge — that
  findings banked *without* an explicit verify-push may carry the same superficiality that verify-requests keep
  exposing — each of the five findings banked this session without a push (B205–B209) was **independently
  re-derived from scratch** (5 parallel adversarial verifiers + own confirmation of every substantive fix).
  **Verdict: every load-bearing *number* held (the math is correct in all five), but the prediction was right for
  the *framings* and *tests*.** Fixes applied in place: **B206 (real over-claim)** — "golden is the *unique*
  metallic mean whose spin shadow is McKay-E₈ / field 5 only for m=1,4" is **false** (a cap-`m≤8` artifact + a
  field-vs-shadow conflation): the field is exactly `ℚ(√5)` for the whole Lucas family `{1,4,11,29,…}` and the
  `2I=SL(2,𝔽₅)` shadow appears for every `m` with `5∣m²+4` (since `⟨R,L⟩=SL(2,ℤ)` surjects mod 5 for *any* m) →
  corrected to "golden = the **minimal/fundamental** member of the `ℚ(√5)/E₈` family," and the test now locks the
  genuine **surjection** `⟨R,L⟩→120` (the prior lock checked only one element's order 10 — the same gap caught in
  B210/V210). **B207 (framing over-reach)** — the "volumes → Borromean" limit was asserted from a value-coincidence
  + an Aitken estimate (~3·10⁻³ short); the structural drill that *earns* it lives in B211/L31 — FINDINGS reworded
  and the fragile `<0.01` Aitken lock replaced with honest "approaches, bounded-above" bounds. **B205 (test
  soft-spot)** — the `is_automorphism` relation-clause was **vacuous** (applied the map to an already-reduced=0
  relation; returned True even for `X→2X`); the math is right (`R_q,L_q` *are* automorphisms) but the check now
  substitutes images into the un-reduced relation + three negative controls. **B208 (under-claim upgraded)** — the
  divisibility `squarefree(m²+4) ∣ P(m)` is in fact a **theorem** (proven; 0 failures to m=300 000), not just
  "checked m=1..300". **B209 (confirmed)** — `Λ*(ℝ⁶)` under A₅ `=(64,0,4,4,4)`, all mult 4, spinorial `{2,2,4,6}`
  absent, fully re-derived; added an explicit dimension-saturation lock. Firewalls all clean; **nothing to
  `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.** The honest meta-lesson: the banked *quantities* were sound, but two
  uniqueness-framings and three tests carried exactly the predicted superficiality — verify-don't-trust now applied
  to one's own quietly-banked work.
- **Verification corrections (Phase V, 2026-06-23): B192 REFUTED, B189 framing fix.** An independent adversarial
  verification pass on the recent batch (B189/B192/B196) cleared **B196/S037** (identities exact, firewall airtight)
  but caught two problems. **B192 — the Lyapunov "parity law" is REFUTED** (retracted in place to a recorded
  negative): the claimed *symmetric-iff-`n`-even / special-to-metallic* law was an artifact of cherry-picked
  energies (it **inverts** on a fair energy grid — n=4→0.34, n=3→0.03, n=6→0.50, no even/odd alternation) plus a
  rigged dense-Gaussian control (a *random potential* in the same companion matches metallic, n=4: 0.34). The
  approximate ±-symmetry is a generic reciprocal-pair transfer-matrix property, not a law and not metallic-special;
  V29 holds at the algebra level but is *not* realized as a Lyapunov parity. Only "spectrum sums to 0" survives;
  **B166's original results are unchanged.** **B189 — framing fix**: the C3 "indistinguishable from the null"
  overstated — Ω's `d_MM=3.94` sits `~0.15` (≈12σ, 30 seeds) **above** the null `3.78` (sparser/more tree-like → even
  *less* manifoldlike); same *order* (both ~4 graded-DAG artifacts), and the headline (d≈4 is an artifact, vacuous as
  physics) **stands and is strengthened**. Reproducers/tests/FINDINGS/ledger/OPEN_LEADS reworded. (verify-don't-trust
  working — the 3rd and 4th self-corrections of the Masterplan III batch, after B190.)

### Added
- **S041 — the framework search started: the object's signatures as a filter against SM/GR frameworks; first
  verdict = structural rhymes, no crossing (2026-06-27; V234).** Owner ask (via chat1): use the object as a filter
  against heterotic / F-theory / Connes NCG / moonshine. Started with discipline (a shared object = the null
  hypothesis; a *crossing* needs a derivation + a null test, HELD). Skeptical scout: **F-theory** — generic
  modularity only, and the special CM→rational-N=(2,2)-SCFT realization is *blocked* (40a1 is non-CM, a Betti
  object); **heterotic** — same E₈ algebra, different role (Galois/McKay vs gauge); **NCG** — no shared data;
  **moonshine — the one genuine HOOK** — the object's dual McKay E₈+E₆ (E₇ excluded, B210) are exactly McKay's
  Monster- and Fischer-seeding diagrams, so the object's arithmetic *selects Monster+Fischer, excludes the Baby
  Monster* — but shared rep-theory, not physics. **Verdict:** every overlap a structural rhyme; the firewall holds
  a 5th time, now against external frameworks. Continuation registered (deeper super-moonshine scout; novelty-check
  the E₈+E₆−E₇ selection). Firewalled (S041); novelty UNCHECKED. **Nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.**
- **B230 — golden's SUSY-uniqueness is robust to AFM/FM; the FM "silver SUSY" is a central-charge coincidence,
  not real (2026-06-27; V233).** A stress-test of B224/B228 (chat1) with a verify-don't-trust catch. The su(2)_k
  chain: AFM → M(k+1,k+2), FM → Z_k parafermion (`c=2(k-1)/(k+2)`). A naive c-test flags silver FM (Z₆,
  `c=5/4=c(SM(6))`) — but the Z₆ parafermion (`SU(2)₆/U(1)`) and SM(6) (`(SU(2)₄×SU(2)₂)/SU(2)₆`) are **different
  cosets → different CFTs**, so it's a central-charge coincidence, **not** SUSY. With B228's rigorous coset
  criterion, the only genuine N=1 super metallic chain in *any* coupling is golden+AFM (= TCI). So golden's
  SUSY-uniqueness is **robust to AFM/FM**, and the episode reinforces "use the coset identity, not c-matching."
  Also this PR: B226 FINDINGS updated (the two faces are *algebraically unified* by B228's SU(2)₃ coset coincidence,
  not merely "SU(2)₃ on both sides"); registered the B227 near-square observation `|H₁|=(2m²+7)²+2 ⇒ |H₁|≡3 mod 4`.

- **B229 — the TCI's two 3d-3d bulk realizations are different 3-manifolds: one CFT, two bulks (2026-06-26;
  V232).** The L45 residual completed — the explicit **super-Seifert** dual of the tricritical Ising. Both 3d-3d
  recipes share the form `S²((P,P−R),(Q,S),(3,1))`, differing only by the determinant = the SU(2) level: **ordinary
  `M(P,Q)` has `PS−QR=1` (SU(2)₁); super `SM(P,Q)` has `PS−QR=2` (SU(2)₂)**. So the TCI realizes as: ordinary
  M(4,5) → `S²(3,4,5)`, `|H₁|=83`; super SM(3,5) → `S²(3,3,5)`, `|H₁|=66`. **Same boundary CFT (c=7/10; the cosets
  coincide, B228) but different bulk 3-manifold** — one CFT, two distinct bulks, distinguished by the
  SU(2)₁-vs-SU(2)₂ structure; the coset coincidence does *not* lift to the bulk. Only golden is both (the metallic
  ordinary models have `|P−Q|=1`, the unitary super series `|P−Q|=2`; the unique overlap is TCI = M(4,5) = SM(3,5)).
  Ordinary recipe `[verified]` (B227); TCI=SM(3,5) `[verified]` (super c-formula, arXiv:2405.05746); super recipe
  `[cited]` (verbatim abstract, arXiv:2511.04524); super `|H₁|=66` `[computed]`, not anchored on a published super
  worked example (flagged; the different-base-orbifold conclusion needs only the recipe-fixed cone orders). 5 pytest

- **B228 — the mechanism behind golden's SUSY-uniqueness: the ordinary/super coset coincidence at SU(2)₃
  (2026-06-26; V231).** The L45 follow-on, answered cleanly **in-sandbox** (no Seifert recipe needed). The ordinary
  minimal model `M(m,m+1) = (SU(2)_{m−2}×SU(2)₁)/SU(2)_{m−1}` and the N=1 super minimal model
  `SM(m') = (SU(2)_{m'−2}×SU(2)₂)/SU(2)_{m'}` **coincide** (same numerator multiset + denominator) only at
  `(m,m')=(4,3)` — the **TCI, denominator SU(2)₃ (golden)**. So `SU(2)₃` is the unique level where the
  `SU(2)₁`-based (ordinary) and `SU(2)₂`-based (super) coset constructions coincide — the **structural** reason
  behind B224's central-charge uniqueness (deepens "c-coincidence" → "coset-coincidence"). Metallic statement:
  chain `m` has GKO denominator `SU(2)_{m²+2}`, which is `SU(2)₃` only for `m=1`, so **golden is the unique metallic
  chain whose coset is also a super-minimal-model coset** — settling the L45 follow-on without the super-Seifert
  recipe. Verified in-sandbox (both coset families reproduce the known central charges; the coincidence is unique).

- **B227 — L45: the metallic SUSY chains have explicit Seifert 3-manifold duals (2026-06-26; V230).** The concrete
  lead from the L43 scout. B224's metallic chains flow to `M(m²+4, m²+3)`; Gang–Kang–Kim (arXiv:2405.16377, recipe
  verified) realize `M(P,Q)` as a class-R theory on Seifert `S²((P,P−R),(Q,S),(3,1))`. For the metallic family the
  condition `PS−QR=1` is solved by **`(R,S)=(1,1)` for all m** → **`S²((m²+4, m²+3),(m²+3,1),(3,1))`** (m=1
  reproduces the paper's TCI Seifert, `|H₁|=83`). **Pattern:** cone orders `(m²+4, m²+3, 3)` — largest = the
  **metallic discriminant** `m²+4` (5,8,13,20,29,…); `|H₁| = 4m⁴+28m²+51 = (2m²+7)²+2`; all base orbifolds
  hyperbolic → `SL₂~`/non-hyperbolic (consistent with B226). So the metallic SUSY chains are the subfamily of
  unitary-minimal-model Seifert spaces with largest cone order = a metallic discriminant — a concrete bridge from
  the repo's metallic structure to the active 3d-3d minimal-model program. Recipe `[cited]`, construction/invariants
  `[exact]` (4 pytest locks; `|H₁|` cross-checked vs sage Smith form; m=1 validated vs the published TCI). Follow-on
  (open): golden-SUSY-uniqueness as a Seifert-overlap with the SUSY-minimal-model family. Novelty UNCHECKED.

- **B226 — L43 resolved: the two SUSYs are two faces, separated by the hyperbolic/non-hyperbolic divide
  (2026-06-26; V229).** The deepest open question (chat1): the same golden/figure-eight object carries SUSY twice —
  the licensed 3d-3d SUSY (`T[4₁]` N=2, `M_SUSY=M_flat`=40a1) and the emergent N=1 superconformal chain SUSY
  (`c=7/10`). One structure or two? **Two faces.** A literature scout (WebSearch/WebFetch): 2D Virasoro minimal
  models — *including the supersymmetric ones (the tricritical Ising)* — are realized as 3d bulk theories from
  **non-hyperbolic (Seifert / torus-knot)** 3-manifolds via `T[SU(2)]`/`SU(2)_k` (Gang et al.,
  arXiv:2405.16377 → TCI via Seifert `S²((5,−1),(4,5),(3,1))`; 2511.04524=JHEP 03(2026)066; 2512.23122). The
  **figure-eight is hyperbolic** → its 3d-3d theory is the complex-SL(2,ℂ)/3d-gravity object (`Vol=2.03`,
  arXiv:2401.13900), **not** a minimal model. So the shared ingredient is `SU(2)₃`/`T[SU(2)]`, **not** the
  figure-eight's geometry — the golden-chain CFT (TCI) and the figure-eight knot sit on opposite sides of the
  hyperbolicity divide, two distinct 3-manifolds in the same Class-R framework. (Rhymes with B217's
  closed-Sol/cusped-hyperbolic split.) Exact `4₁` 3d-3d→2d reduction stays NEEDS-SPECIALIST; the qualitative
  answer is settled. Firewalled (S040); central charges `[exact]`, the split `[literature-grounded]`. **Nothing to

- **B225 — conductor-decomposition test: 5 = golden filling (holds), 2 = octahedral parent (refuted) (2026-06-26;
  V228).** A verify-don't-trust test of chat1's "game-changer": does 40a1's conductor `40=2³·5` split as
  `(octahedral parent 2) × (golden filling 5)`? With a validated 2-bridge pipeline (reproduces B211's `Φ` and bad
  primes `{2,5}=40a1`): **SOLID** — `5` is the golden filling (the figure-eight branch locus `(x²−1)(x²−5)`; the
  `x²=5` branch = the golden monodromy discriminant `t²−4=5` for trace 3). **REFUTED** — `2` is not the octahedral
  parent: prime 2 appears in *every* 2-bridge knot, twist (Whitehead fillings) **and non-twist** (`6_2,6_3,7_6,
  8_3,8_8,9_4`), so it is universal to 2-bridge character varieties, not parent-specific. So `40` does **not**
  decompose as `(parent)×(filling)`. Foundations verified (Whitehead/Borromean ℚ(i) prime 2; fig-8 ℚ(√−3) prime 3;
  golden ℚ(√5) prime 5). Method limit: disc-of-disc overcounts for genus ≥ 2 (clean only `4_1`,`5_2`); higher

  "close the circle." The su(2)_k anyon chain → minimal model `M(k+1,k+2)` (Feiguin–Trebst–Ludwig; `k=3`→`M(4,5)`
  `c=7/10` = the golden chain, reproduced B220/B222). **Among all unitary minimal models `M(q,q+1)`, only `M(4,5)`
  is N=1 superconformal** (= SM(3); the only `c<1` solution of `1−6/(q(q+1))=(3/2)(1−8/(p(p+2)))`). In the metallic
  family (level `k_m=m²+2`, since `n=k+2=m²+4` = the discriminant): `m=1`→`c=7/10` (SUSY); `m=2`(silver)→`25/28`;
  `m=3`(bronze)→`25/26`; `c_m→1`, none superconformal but golden. So **golden is the unique metallic mean whose
  chain is supersymmetric** — the SUSY point needs exactly the golden level `k=3` (`n=5=m²+4`). Closes the circle:
  golden is minimal, exceptional (`E₈`/`E₆`), least-hierarchical, **and** uniquely supersymmetric — all via `5=m²+4`

  Ising `M(4,5)` = the **first N=1 superconformal minimal model**, so the object's multiplicity (golden, B218)

  no-two-adjacent-identities; Hilbert dim = Lucas `L_N`); local term = projector onto the **identity** fusion
  channel, the only nontrivial piece the `(τ,τ)` rank-1 block `P = F·diag(1,0)·F = [[φ⁻²,φ⁻³ᐟ²],[φ⁻³ᐟ²,φ⁻¹]]`.
  **The bug before:** the off-diagonal `φ⁻³ᐟ²` (the kinetic term) was dropped → a trivially gapped chain. With
  `H_AFM=−Σĥ_i`, `c` from the PBC entanglement entropy (slope → `c/3`, no velocity): `N=14..22` is **gapless**
  (`gap·N≈0.86` const) with `c_ent≈0.71` (mean `N≥16` = 0.7135) = **tricritical Ising `c=7/10`**, distinct from 0
  (gapped) and 0.8 (Potts). FM → 3-state Potts `c=4/5` consistent but noisier. So the chain CFT is now

  specialist (genus theory); the actual answer is **elementary**. The period-controlling invariant is the
  binary-quadratic-form **content** `content(γ)=gcd(b,c,a−d)` = the largest modulus where `γ ≡ s·I` for *any* scalar
  `s`. **Theorem (verified):** `P(γ)=lcm(t−2,t+2)/content(γ)`, a function of `(trace, content)` **only — no genus
  dependence**. B216 tested `γ≡±I` (only ±1), which fails at `f=8` because `(ℤ/2^k)^×` has extra square-roots of 1
  for `k≥3` (mod 8 = {1,3,5,7}); `GAMMA_A=[[13,−8],[−8,5]]≡5·I (mod 8)` → true content 8, not 4. **Decisive:**
  exhaustive `f=8` (`t=18`, `D=320`, all four genera) — every content-1 class has period 80 (334 reps), content-2→40,
  content-4→20, content-8→10; **genus-independent** (B216's "not minimal" flags were short-window detector false

  first anyon-chain Hamiltonian was buggy/gapped, the XXZ proxy under-resolved near criticality; flagged, not
  banked). **Firewall (the thesis limit):** what multiplicity selects is a **dimensionless topological/CFT
  structure** (an anyon theory, a central charge), **not** physical content/scale — chiral fermions + the SM are
  theorem-blocked (Nielsen–Ninomiya). So "content from multiplicity" = **selected topology** (golden / Fibonacci /
  tricritical-Ising), not emergent scale — the most positive honest answer the object supports. Novelty UNCHECKED.

- **B217 — L40 resolved: the Borromean bridge is the geometric origin of the VOLUME (cusped), not the period
  (closed/algebraic) (2026-06-26; V220).** chat1's L40 asked whether B204's period law has a geometric origin via
  the Borromean parent (L31). **Answer (computed): no** — the period and the Borromean live on *different*
  manifolds sharing only the monodromy `γ` (the closed-Sol / cusped-hyperbolic duality, V200). (1) B204's
  `Z_k=tr(ρ_k(γ))` is the **closed** torus bundle: verified `Z_k(identity)=Z(T³)=k+1`; the figure-eight closed
  bundle is the period-5 `1/φ` object — **the period is algebraic** (B204–B216). (2) The **cusped** figure-eight
  (m004 = 2 ideal tetrahedra; the metallic family = Borromean Dehn fillings, L31) carries the hyperbolic **volume**
  via the Kashaev volume conjecture: `(2π/N)log⟨4_1⟩_N → Vol=2.02988` (confirmed with the Ohtsuki `(3π logN)/N`
  correction). **The Borromean parent governs the VOLUME, not the period.** A Borromean surgery presentation of the
  closed bundle reproduces `Z_k` only by topological invariance — a re-presentation, never an explanation —
  confirming + sharpening chat1's caveat (it can only reproduce; it actually governs a *different* invariant). So
  the period's origin is algebraic (trace/Gauss sums); the Borromean/geometric content is the volume. Novelty
  UNCHECKED (closed/cusped + volume conjecture classical; the L40 resolution for this family is the contribution).
  Firewall: standalone quantum-topology/hyperbolic geometry; **nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.** The
  WRT-period arc (B204→B214→B215→B216→B217) is now complete in-sandbox; the f≥8 genus theory is the specialist
  residual.
- **B216 — the f≥8 boundary of the class-field period law: genus-theoretic, NEEDS-SPECIALIST (2026-06-26; V219).**
  The focused attack on L39 (B215's `f≥8` residual). (A) Built a **correct, validated general WRT factorization**
  (`SL(2,ℤ)→S,T`) so `Z_k(γ)=tr(ρ_k(γ))` is computable for *arbitrary* `γ`, not just block words — validated to
  machine precision against B204/B214's block-word `Z` (a real bug in a first quick version was caught and fixed:
  the `e=−1` final block is `S²T^{−m}`, not `−T^m`). (B) **The obstruction:** at `f=8` (`t=18`, `D=320`) two
  **non-conjugate** classes `[[13,−8],[−8,5]]` (d=8) and `[[17,−4],[−4,1]]` (d=4) have **identical** elementary
  invariants (scalar-depth 4, order-profile (1,1,2,4)) — so `d` is **not** a function of scalar-depth or
  order-mod-2^k; it is a finer **form-class / genus** invariant (Latimer–Macduffee = the repo's B92). All
  elementary refinements fail uniformly. **Verdict:** the full `f≥8` law is genus-theoretic (2-adic genus /
  spinor-genus / metaplectic level) → **NEEDS-SPECIALIST** — a *named* boundary (the counterexample + the validated
  tool), reached by computing to **exhaustion** of the elementary methods. B215 stands exact for `f∈{2,3,4}`.
  Novelty UNCHECKED. Firewall: standalone quantum-topology/arithmetic; **nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.**

- **B215 — the class-field period law: the closed form for B214's conductor-split (2026-06-26; V218).** Hunted and
  **found** the closed form: `P(γ) = lcm(t−2,t+2)/d(γ)`, with `d(γ) = max{d′∣f : γ ≡ ±I (mod d′)}` — the
  **scalar-reduction depth** of the conjugacy class (how deep `γ` reduces to the center `±I`). **Verified exact for
  conductor `f ∈ {2,3,4}`** (every class at `t=6,7,10,11,14,22`; the depth ranges over all divisors of `f`). The
  SL(2,ℤ) classes of trace `t` are the ideal classes of the order `ℤ[λ]` of conductor `f` (Latimer–Macduffee = the
  repo's B92), so the period reads the **form class** via its scalar depth — `B204 → B214 → B92`. **Named boundary
  (open):** at `f=8` (`t=18`, the golden field with conductor 8) the law is incomplete — the `≡I mod 4` class splits
  by `d=4` as predicted, but two order-2-mod-2 classes split by an extra factor 2 the scalar criterion misses (and a
  naive "order-2" rule is refuted: `f=2`'s order-2 class has `d=1`, `f=8`'s have `d=2`); the higher-2-power split is
  a finer 2-adic phenomenon → NEEDS-SPECIALIST. Novelty UNCHECKED (Gauss-sum period theory classical; the
  scalar-depth form is the candidate-new piece). Firewall: standalone quantum-topology/arithmetic; **nothing to

- **B214 — the general-word WRT period law + its class-field refinement + the Funar deflation (2026-06-26; V217).**
  Extends B204 off the metallic diagonal: for *arbitrary* hyperbolic words `γ=∏R^{aᵢ}L^{bᵢ}∈SL(2,ℤ)`, the WRT
  level-period is, **on the principal class, `P(γ)=lcm(det(γ−I),det(γ+I))=lcm(tr−2,tr+2)`** (verified on many
  words, distinct traces, incl. non-symmetric). **The new content — a class-field refinement:** the period reads
  the conjugacy / **ideal class** (Latimer–Macduffee; the repo's B92), not just the trace — at *fundamental*
  discriminant `D=t²−4` (conductor `f=1`) all classes share the period, but at conductor `f>1` it **splits**
  (non-principal classes get `lcm/d`, `d∣f`: `D=32→{8,4}`, `D=45→{45,15}`, `D=320→{80,40}`); B204 lived where
  `h=1`, so the split was invisible. **The deflation (verify-don't-trust on both an over-read and a relayed
  claim):** three trace-15 words give identical `|Z|`, but that is neither "content from interaction" (a same
  monodromy giving the same invariant is the *definition* of a topological invariant) **nor** "all three are
  conjugate" (orbit reduction: `M₁~M₂` conjugate, but `M₀` is **not** — yet identical `|Z|`, period 221 = **Funar's**
  non-conjugate-same-WRT phenomenon). So `|Z|`-equality ≠ conjugacy; the banked content is the formula + the
  conductor-split. Novelty: Jeffrey + Funar known; the conductor-split closed form is the candidate-new piece
  (UNCHECKED). Firewall: standalone quantum-topology/arithmetic; **nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.** Next:

- **B213 + S039 — the do-or-die program, Act I: the Higgs-side period data (firewalled; 2026-06-25; V216).** The
  owner's do-or-die question (explain the cosmological-constant problem / unify QM–GR) taken at full weight, behind
  the firewall (`speculations/S039`, POSTULATED). The move: the firewall (no invariant sources a scale) is banked
  across 3 modes (K018); the one bridge built-up-to-but-not-crossed is the **Hitchin/Higgs side**, where the scale
  would live (B169). B211 gave the key — the figure-eight character variety **is** the elliptic curve `40a1`, a
  genuine Higgs-side handle. **Act I (computed):** does it carry a forced tiny dimensionless number (a CC-hierarchy
  candidate)? **No** — `40a1` data all `O(1)`/BSD-generic (`Ω=1.484`, `L(E,1)=0.742`, `L/Ω=1/2` exact, `Ш=1`,
  regulator 1, Mahler `m(Φ)=0.742≈Ω/2`); the **null test** kills the only candidate (`L/Ω=1/2` is generic — every
  rank-0 curve gives a simple BSD rational), so no numerology survives (S014 stays dead). **The firewall holds a
  4th independent time, now on the Higgs side** (confirms B181: criticality ⇒ no hierarchy). Structural find:
  conductor `40=2³·5` sees the golden/`E₈` prime 5 (`ℚ(√5)`), not the hyperbolic prime 3 — the variety is a Betti
  object, its arithmetic tracks the Betti/monodromy side. **The positive structural claim banked (S039, [LEAP]):**
  vacuum-energy scale is a **form↔filling matching datum**, not an intrinsic output; the canonical object
  (figure-eight) sits *at* the `Λ=0` vacuum `κ=−2` (B67). Not a solution — a proof, in a fully-computable toy, of
  *where the scale must come from and why this structure cannot supply it.* Acts II/III + the metallic tower stay
  open. Firewall: physics readings are one-way HOOKs; no `[proved]`; **nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched;**

- **B212 — the metallic congruence/monodromy shadow, computed (corrects B210's silver line; 2026-06-25; V213).**
  chat1 flagged that B210's "silver = degenerate prime 2 → S₃ both sides" was *assumed by analogy* — the exact
  asserted-not-computed pattern the golden verify-it-all pass (V210) and the V212 re-audit kept catching. Computed:
  (1) the **congruence-group shadow** `⟨R,L⟩ mod (m²+4) = SL(2,ℤ/N)` (golden 120=2I=E₈, silver 384=SL(2,ℤ/8),
  bronze 2184=SL(2,𝔽₁₃)) — a property of the modulus; (2) the **monodromy element** `RᵐLᵐ mod p` is order `2Q(m)`
  generically but **`≡ I` for even m** — silver `R²L² ≡ I mod 2` is **trivial, not S₃** (the "S₃" is the `⟨R,L⟩`
  *group*, conflated); (3) the **proved law** `RᵐLᵐ≡I mod p ⇔ p∣m ⇔ p=2,m even` (m=1..15); (4) the **hyperbolic**
  shadow (m136 via snap) is trace-**degenerate** — silver's square-traces `2,±2i` all `≡0 mod (1+i)` ⇒ no order-3
  element survives (no McKay-exceptional structure, vs golden's full `2T=E₆`), while the holonomy is a **quaternion
  order over ℚ(i)** (square-matrices not in `SL(2,ℤ[i])`) so the image-**group** is a named residual. Net: B210's
  silver line corrected; golden's `2T=E₆`/`2I=E₈` (integral & full) unaffected. Firewall: McKay rep-theory, not
  physics; **nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.** Resolves `OPEN_LEADS` L35 (+ the L29 shadow-structure).
- **B211 — the metallic family's three faces: geometric limit, chirality spectrum, and the arithmetic of the
  variety itself (2026-06-25; V211).** The six remaining *computable* leads (L29–L34), run properly and verified —
  each computed (not asserted), with its load-bearing step locked in a test. **Headline (L34, a new arithmetic
  face):** the arithmetic of the character *variety* itself (its Weil zeta over `𝔽_p`), never touched — all prior
  arithmetic was a number *field* (monodromy `ℚ(√(m²+4))` or hyperbolic trace `ℚ(√−3)`). The figure-eight's
  non-abelian `SL(2,ℂ)` character variety polynomial `Φ(x,z)=z²−(x²+1)z+(2x²−1)` is **derived** from the Riley
  relator and **verified** at the complete structure (`x=2 → u²+u+1`, roots `ω`). It is an irreducible genus-1 curve
  and **`#X^{na}(𝔽_p) = p − 1 − a_p(E)` exactly** (23 good primes `p≤97`) for `E: y²=x(x−1)(x−5) =` Cremona
  **`40a1`** (conductor 40, `j=148176/25`, **non-CM**, rank 0): the variety is birational to a weight-2 newform of
  level 40 — *not* the `ℚ(√−3)` of the trace field (whose ramified prime 3 isn't even among the variety's bad primes
  `{2,5}`). **L31:** drilling the short core geodesics of `RᵐLᵐ` returns `m`-independently the **Borromean rings
  complement** (`6³₂=L6a4=t12067`, two ideal octahedra, vol `2·v_oct`) — the metallic bundles are large-twist Dehn
  fillings of one fixed parent (corrects B207's then-unearned "→Borromean"). **L32:** every `RᵐLᵐ` (`m=1..6`) is
  **amphichiral** (isometric to its orientation-reversal) ⇒ `CS=0` for all `m` (firewall L15 holds family-wide).
  **L33:** the B204 WRT level-period **is a Pisano period** of `x_{n+1}=m·x_n+x_{n−1}` (`π(m,m²+4)=4Q(m)`,
  `P_WRT=(m/4)π`). **L29:** `ord(RᵐLᵐ mod m²+4)=2Q(m)`. **L30 (resolved-neg):** the skein quotient at
  `q=e^{2πi/5}` (`SU(2)₃` Verlinde, rank 4) is **not** the `2I` rep ring (rank 9) — consistent with B210's WRT image
  of order 2880; the WRT/skein↔shadow link is arithmetic (B208), not a rep-ring identity. Novelty **UNCHECKED** on
  L34 (the `40a1`/Weil-zeta framing — the polynomial is classical), L31 (likely folklore), L33 (Pisano standard);

- **B210 — golden's dual McKay (E₈ + E₆); WRT image ≠ 2I; computable-paths catalog (2026-06-25; V209).** Two
  uncomputed paths, run. **(1) Dual McKay:** the metallic bundles' *complex* hyperbolic invariant trace fields
  (the cusped manifold's arithmetic, distinct from the real monodromy field) — golden = `ℚ(√−3)` (m004),
  silver = `ℚ(i)` (m136), bronze deg 8, m=4 deg 4. So golden carries **both** exceptional McKay-congruence
  groups: `E₈` (monodromy `ℚ(√5)` mod 5) **and** `E₆` (hyperbolic `ℚ(√−3)` mod 3) — the two exceptional McKay
  primes {3,5}; `E₇=2O` excluded (not a congruence quotient). Golden is the *unique* metallic mean hitting
  exceptional McKay primes on both arithmetics (silver = degenerate 2; bronze+ non-arithmetic). **(2)
  Resolved-negative:** the WRT modular-rep image at the golden level is order **2880** (`SL(2,ℤ/20)`-related),
  **not** `2I` — so the quantum face is a bigger object; the WRT↔shadow link is purely arithmetic (`m²+4`, B208),
  not a group iso. Also **marked all computable paths** (`OPEN_LEADS` L27–L34, with status). Novelty UNCHECKED;
  McKay/rep-theoretic `E₆`/`E₈`, not physics; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.
- **B209 — the classical/quantum boundary: the tiling sees A₅, the spinorial E₈-completion is absent (2026-06-25; V208).**
  The icosahedral quasicrystal's exterior algebra `Λ*(ℝ⁶)` (A₅ acting via `3⊕3'`) decomposes into exactly the **5
  bosonic A₅ irreps**, each at multiplicity **4** (total `64=2⁶`; the golden ratio in the character table cancels
  to a clean 4). The **4 spinorial irreps of the double cover `2I` — `{2,2',4',6}`, exactly the affine-`E₈` nodes
  beyond `A₅` — are absent**: the classical tiling sees only `A₅`; the `E₈`-completing spinorial irreps require
  the quantum/spin lift `2I` (the `SL` level of B206 vs classical `PSL=A₅`). The classical/quantum boundary **is**
  those 4 irreps — the same spin `ℤ/2` as B206, made concrete as which representations are visible classically vs
  only quantumly. McKay/representation-theoretic `E₈`, not physics' `E₈`; firewalled. Nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B208 + synthesis punchline — the WRT period and the congruence shadow are the same arithmetic (2026-06-25; V207).**
  B204 (the WRT period, Face IV) and B206 (the congruence shadow, Face I) are two reads of one homological
  invariant `det(γ+I)=m²+4`: `squarefree(m²+4)` (the field radicand) **always divides** `P(m)`, and at golden the
  three collapse — `P(1)=5 = det(γ+I) = disc ℚ(√5) = the McKay prime`, `SL(2,𝔽₅)=2I=E₈` (the three 5's are one).
  And `papers/metallic_one_object/SYNTHESIS.md` finally gets its **punchline (§9)**: the four faces are shadows of
  one conjugacy class whose arithmetic shadow at disc 5 is the unique exceptional McKay group — golden-specific
  because 5 is *simultaneously* the smallest fundamental discriminant (extremal) and the largest McKay prime
  (exceptional); the minimal point and the exceptional point are the same point, for the same reason. Nothing to
  `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.
- **B207 (symmetry-breaking door, finished) — no GUT chain (2026-06-25; V206).** Finished the symmetry-breaking
  door with a clean **arithmetic negative**: `E₆=2T=SL(2,𝔽₃)` never occurs (`m²+4≡1,2 mod 3`, 3 never ramifies);
  `E₇=2O` never occurs (`|2O|=48` is no `|SL(2,𝔽_p)|`); only `E₈` (`ℚ(√5)`, m=1,4,11) is hit. So the `E₈→E₆`
  branch is golden's *internal* subgroup lattice, **not** a family-realized chain, and the dynamics selects
  `2D₅` not `2T`. The object does **not** realize a GUT-style symmetry-breaking chain — the firewall holds; the
  genuine structures are the κ=2 wall (dynamical) and golden's isolated `E₈`. Flips the S038 item to
  done-negative. Nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B207 (scale door, computed) — the metallic bundle volumes are bounded (2026-06-25; V205).** Pushed the
  scale door with SnapPy: the hyperbolic volumes of `RᵐLᵐ` (m=1=figure-eight) are **bounded and converge** —
  golden = `2·v_tet` (the minimal cusped hyperbolic volume), silver = `v_oct` exactly (m136), `Vol_m ↗ 2·v_oct`
  (Borromean) as m→∞. So the volume-conjecture rate `e^{N·Vol_m/2π}` **saturates**: the object can't supply an
  unbounded exponential rate; **all unbounded scale is the level `N`** — confirms + sharpens the firewall (B151).
  Golden = the minimal rate (extremal again). *Verify-don't-trust:* an initial pass misread the volumes as
  linear growth; canonizing to geometric triangulations showed convergence. Flips the S038 scale item to done.
  Nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B207 + S038 — the firewall-content push: scale & symmetry breaking (2026-06-25; V204).** Per owner steer
  (keep the math threads; push the firewall content questions). Firewall-clean math (`frontier/B207`) + the
  firewalled reading (`speculations/S038`, POSTULATED, one-way, nothing to `CLAIMS.md`). **Symmetry breaking:**
  the golden shadow `2I=SL(2,𝔽₅)=E₈` (B206) read as `G→H` — the metallic dynamics `⟨RL⟩` selects residual
  `2D₅`; the finite McKay sub-chain `2I⊃2T(=E₆)` but `2I⊉2O(=E₇)`, so golden's shadow breaks **`E₈→E₆`,
  skipping `E₇`** (icosahedron has no octahedral subgroup) — *finite-group structure, firewalled from gauge*;
  and breaking is *generic not fine-tuned* (the κ=2 wall). **Scale:** the metallic dimensionless scale-spectrum
  grows only **logarithmically** (no intrinsic exponential hierarchy), so any hierarchy is a quantization-**level**
  effect (volume conjecture), not the geometry — *confirms* the firewall (B151) and *locates* where a scale
  would enter; golden is the *least-hierarchical* point (the triple coincidence at 5: extremal + exceptional +
  least-hierarchical). Negatives kept prominent (gauge free, spacetime (1,1), chirality mirror-closed, no
  absolute scale — the closed doors). Both pushes confirm relocation, do not breach. Nothing to `CLAIMS.md`;
  P1–P16 untouched.
- **B206 — the golden object's spin shadow is 2I = SL(2,𝔽₅) = McKay-E₈ (2026-06-25; V203).** The McKay seam
  question, computed (not hedged). The golden mean (`m=1`, field `ℚ(√5)`, disc 5) has congruence shadow
  `SL(2,𝔽₅) = 2I` (binary icosahedral = McKay partner of affine `E₈`). Classical/trace level = `PSL(2,𝔽₅)=A₅`
  (5 irreps); quantum/spin level = `SL(2,𝔽₅)=2I` (9 irreps = affine `E₈` marks); the `ℤ/2` between them is the
  center `{±I}` = the spin cover SU(2)→SO(3) = the half-trace `κ=4I+2`; the **4 extra spinorial irreps `{2,2,4,6}`**
  are what the quantum level sees and the classical cannot. So "does the quantum level carry spinorial structure
  the classical can't?" = **yes, structurally** (not a φ-rhyme). **Golden-specific:** `SL(2,𝔽_p)` is
  binary-polyhedral only for `p≤5`, and only the `ℚ(√5)` family (`m=1,4`) hits disc 5 — golden is the unique
  metallic mean whose spin shadow is McKay-`E₈`. **Honest:** ingredients all standard (assembly is the
  contribution); novelty **UNCHECKED** (golden↔`E₈` known in physics, Coldea 2010; → L26). **Firewall:** this is

  Fibonacci/quasicrystal spectrum (`κ=2+λ²`, Kohmoto), **(IV)** quantum (WRT = Jeffrey 1992 at roots of unity;

  torus: `4+ab=det(γ+I)` (homology) × `lcm(a,b)` (twist). **Why the metallic family is special:** the constant phase
  `e^{−2πi(a−b)/(4n)}` is 1 iff `a=b`, so metallic `Z` is *real* and periodic; for `a≠b` only `|Z|` is periodic.
  **Periodicity PROVED (V198, `PROOF.md`):** `Z̃` extends to a full period (`sin²` vanishes at the boundary) →
  clean Gauss sums; Landsberg–Schaar gives the diagonal (the `√(2n)` amplitudes cancel `1/(2n)` — why a
  growing-dimension trace stays bounded & periodic), 2D Gauss reciprocity gives the cross (binary form
  `det = −(4+ab) = −det(γ+I)`); `per(diagonal)=lcm(a,b)` is proved. The exact period is verified on 14 cells; a
  closed form for the cross Gauss-sum period is the one remaining lemma to full `[proved]`.
  **Corrects** the prior exploratory memo ("no clean law / period absent when `m²+4` prime" — a search-bound artifact;
  `m=1`, disc 5 prime, has the smallest period). **Novelty CHECKED (V199, `NOVELTY.md`) — DEFLATED:** an
  adversarial 99-agent prior-art pass found the framework **and** the proof mechanism are KNOWN — `Z_k=tr(ρ_k(A))`
  of a torus-bundle mapping torus as a quadratic Gauss sum via reciprocity is exactly **Jeffrey 1992** (CMP 147,
  eq 4.8 for `|Tr|>2`, which already carries *both* `|Tr∓2|` moduli = `ab` and `4+ab`); our proof re-derives her
  method. Exact SU(2)_k periodicity is PARTIALLY-KNOWN (congruence subgroup property + Funar's abelian
  `|Z_k|=|H¹|^{1/2}`); the explicit `(a,b)`-period and metallic reality are APPEARS-NOVEL but NEEDS-SPECIALIST
  (the period likely drops out of Jeffrey eq 4.8; reality likely folklore). **Framing corrected:** `Z_k` is the
  WRT invariant of the **closed-torus** mapping torus (Jeffrey's Sol-manifold object), not the cusped
  punctured-torus bundle — shared monodromy, different 3-manifold. **Do not claim novelty.** Standalone

- **B203 — the 4 silver SL(3) components classified: all irreducible & cusped-type (2026-06-24; V196).** Identifies
  the new silver component (B201's comp3) and **explains B202** (resolves OPEN_LEADS L23(b)). All four components of
  the silver SL(3) character variety are **irreducible** (Burnside dim 9) with **A, B, µ of infinite order**
  (continuous trace) — cusped/loxodromic-type, **none a finite-order-A Dehn-filling component**. So comp3
  (`{tr A+tr A⁻¹=−1, tr B+tr B⁻¹=−1}`, no figure-eight analog) is a *genuine new irreducible* component. **Why this
  explains B202:** the figure-eight's tidy `M³=L`/`M³L=1` live on its *finite-order-A* Dehn-filling components
  (`W1={x1=x4=1}` → `A=diag(1,i,−i)`, order 4); silver has no such torsion locus, so no tidy `[A,B]=c·µᵏ`. The
  figure-eight's tidy Dehn-filling A-variety is a special low-trace phenomenon, absent for m≥2. Completes the silver
  SL(3) story (B201 → B202 → B203); silver SL(3) A-polynomial uniformly Falbel-size → `NEEDS-SPECIALIST` (B199).
  Standalone character-variety math; P1–P16 untouched; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B202 — the silver SL(3) A-variety: no tidy `[A,B]=c·µᵏ` (2026-06-24; V195).** Completes the SL(3)
  metallic-A-polynomial direction (B201 → its peripheral relations; resolves OPEN_LEADS L23(a)). **Result
  (validated):** the silver (m=2) bundle has a *correct commuting* cusp meridian `µ=A⁻²t` (B154; `cdev~1e-9` on all
  four components), but **none of its four character-variety components carries a tidy matrix relation `[A,B]=c·µᵏ`**
  (matexp best-score medians 16.1, 6.5, 2.8, 1.2 — all ≫1e-6) — whereas the figure-eight's Dehn-filling components do
  (`W1: c·µ³ = M³=L`; `W2: c·µ⁻³`). So **the figure-eight's tidy Dehn-filling A-variety is non-generic** in the
  metallic family; the silver A-variety is all-Falbel-size. **Method:** the pairing-free **matrix exponent**
  (`[A,B]·µ⁻ᵏ` scalar; B71/B198), gated on the figure-eight (recovers `M³=L`/`M³L=1` exactly) — fixing the
  eigenvalue-ordering scramble that sank B201 Part 2. Honest SL(3) picture now complete: SL(2) tidy (B67/B69); SL(3)
  figure-eight tidy only on its trace-1 Dehn-filling components (B71); SL(3) silver no tidy component at all (B202) →
  closed-form silver SL(3) A-polynomial `NEEDS-SPECIALIST` (per B199). A verify-don't-trust arc (the ratio pipeline
  failed its gate → not banked → matrix-exponent method gated → the negative banked). Standalone character-variety
  math; P1–P16 untouched; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B201 — the metallic (silver) SL(3) character variety from the trace-map fixed locus (2026-06-24; V194).**
  Extends B71 (figure-eight SL(3)) to the metallic family — the SL(3) face of "the metallic A-polynomial on the
  geometric component" (the object the B199 integer exponent was a shadow of). **Part 1 (banked, exact):** the silver
  (m=2) bundle monodromy `T_2²` (B48 metallic trace map) has fixed locus `Fix(T_2²)` decomposing into **four** dim-2
  components — **one more than the figure-eight's three** — the geometric `{tr A=tr A⁻¹, tr B=tr B⁻¹}` (same form as
  B71's V0, contains Sym²), two Dehn-filling-type, and a **new `{tr A+tr A⁻¹=−1, tr B+tr B⁻¹=−1}` component with no
  figure-eight analog**. m=1 reproduces B71's 3 components exactly (validation). So the silver SL(3) character variety
  is *richer* than the figure-eight's. **Part 2 (deferred, not banked):** the per-component peripheral A-variety
  relations (the silver analog of B71's `M³=L`) — a quick in-house pipeline failed its figure-eight `M³=L` validation
  gate, so per verify-don't-trust nothing from it is banked; the fault is isolated (B71's *native* peripheral machinery
  recovers `M³=L` cleanly), and the correct next step (explicit silver component parametrizations → B71-native
  peripheral with `µ=A⁻²t`) is recorded. Expected: Dehn-filling tidy, geometric Falbel-size (NEEDS-SPECIALIST, per
  B199). Standalone character-variety math; P1–P16 untouched; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B200 — verification of the chat1 independent-computation handoff (2026-06-24; V193).** Three incoming
  "MATH" results re-derived before banking (verify-don't-trust; cf. B197 for chat2). **R2 VERIFIED + banked:**
  *on-site is the unique finite-range interaction preserving the Fibonacci Sturmian alphabet* — the paired potential
  `V_n+V_{n+d}` at d=1 (NN) has 2 values but complexity `p(4)=6` (not Sturmian), d=2 (NNN) has 3 values; only d=0
  preserves it (structural reason: d≥1 sees *pairs*). Refines K019 / the B171–B176 interaction frontier; honest scope
  (alphabet-preserving is a proxy for metallic-preserving). **R1 REFUTED:** the "κ₁=κ₂=3 at U=t doublon fixed point"
  used the *strong-coupling* formula `t_eff=2t²/U` out of regime (at U=t it gives `t_eff=2t`; a genuine 2-body Hubbard
  ED shows no doublon band and RMS 3.77 vs the prediction), and its "RMS=0 verification" was *circular*
  (effective-Fibonacci-chain-with-`λ_eff` vs the single particle, equal by construction at U=t). Recorded refuted.
  **R3 standard ETH** (not banked; its specific Poisson→GOE numbers didn't even reproduce in a quick check). The
  **"not nothing" ladder** stays firewalled/POSTULATED (known results + selection-bias deflation; nothing to
  `CLAIMS.md`). Only R2 survives as a new increment. Standalone condensed-matter / symbolic-dynamics math; P1–P16
  untouched.
- **B199 — the metallic exponent: no closed-form law; the clean exponent is a *sublocus*; SL(5) exact-symbolic
  exhausted (2026-06-24; V192).** A multi-agent **Workflow** (113 agents, ~4.5M tokens, 4h: adversarial verify → law
  propose+judge panel → 4 Goal-B exact routes → deep-research novelty → consolidate) closing the flagship by
  computation. **Three results.** *(A) No closed-form law.* No single-valued `k(o,m)` (or `…,gcd`, or `k(A^m-spectrum)`)
  survives — three decisive, independently-reproduced refuters: the **o=4/o=8 collision** (both → k=3 at m=1; shared
  `eff_o=4` = eigenvalue-ratio-group order — kills `k=7−o`, every `f(o)`, gcd-rules, and the `eff_o` candidate too), the
  **A^m-spectrum collision** (`A²[o4]=A³[o6]=diag(1,−1,−1)` exactly, yet k=2 vs 1), and **non-monotonicity** (o=4 column
  3,2,3; brute force → zero affine fits). The only surviving closed form is the **sign `s=(−1)ⁿ⁻¹`** (splits at o=8).
  The exponent is the structural metallic-A-polynomial slope; order-not-rank survives; degree=rank refuted at SL5
  (k=2≠5). *(B) Verify-don't-trust correction of B198.* The rigid `[A,B]=µ²` holds only on a **~1% rigid sublocus** of
  the dim-4 loxodromic component (grid 8/887; workflow 24/3486) — B198's "305/305 on the geometric component" was an
  `err`-filter selection artifact; the **k=2 value stands** (at the complete cusped rep), only the *scope* is
  down-tiered (B198 corrected in place). At SL3 it holds on the whole component; the sublocus emerges with rank.
  *(C) SL(5) exact-symbolic exhausted.* All four maximal routes → `NEEDS-SPECIALIST` at a sharp wall — the *first*
  degrevlex Gröbner basis at 25 vars does not terminate in 600s over ℚ(ζ₅) *or* F_p; the engines are validated
  exact-mod-p on SL(3); R4 found the k=2 locus is **not rationally parametrizable**. Novelty (19 sources): R1
  PARTIALLY-KNOWN (higher-n + metallic APPEARS-NOVEL), R3 APPEARS-NOVEL. Standalone character-variety math; firewall
  intact; P1–P16 untouched; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B198 — the B157 metallic-exponent wall, breached by computation (2026-06-23; V190).** A direct test of the
  "we compute before deferring to a specialist" directive and the new `GOVERNANCE.md` §6.1 **(C)** guardrail.
  B157 had marked the SL(5)/o≥5 exponent cells `NEEDS-SPECIALIST` ("needs a real CAS"); **two of the three
  premises were tooling/diagnosis, not math.** (1) **Sage is installed in-environment** (`command -v sage`) and
  reproduces the SL(3) cells **exactly** via the geometric component (o=3→k=4, o=4→k=3 — the Gröbner sympy could
  not finish). (2) The "SL(5) Newton wall" was **gauge-induced Jacobian rank-deficiency**; **gauge-fixing** the
  diagonal torus makes Newton converge, reaching the previously-unreachable **SL(5) o=5, m=1 → `[A,B]=+µ²`, k=2**,
  certified three independent ways (two Newton solvers + an mpmath dps=60 certificate where `‖[A,B]−µ²‖` falls in
  *lockstep* with the relation residual to 1.5e-23, proving exactness; `c=+1`; neighbours excluded). This
  **extends the figure-eight (m=1) row to o=5** (note `k=2≠rank 5`, so it *reinforces* B157's "order-determined,
  not degree=rank"); the certified rep is confirmed on the **geometric / cusped component** (meridian `µ`
  loxodromic, infinite order). The wall **moved** — the residual is the *exact-symbolic* `k` at SL(5) (primary
  decomposition at 25 vars; Sage stalls already at SL(4)/16 vars). A first high-precision certificate **failed**
  (a seed-selection bug in the certificate script), was caught and fixed — verify-don't-trust. **Grid follow-up +
  self-correction (same day, V191):** B198's *first-draft* secondary claims — `k=4−m(o−3)` governing m∈{1,2} in
  value+existence-boundary, and a `gcd(m,o)` anomaly lead — were **REFUTED** by extending the grid to o=8 and
  filtering by meridian order: the exponent must be read on the `order(µ)=∞` (cusped) stratum (finite-order-`µ`
  Dehn-filling reps give spurious exponents), and even there **o=4 and o=8 both give k=3** at m=1 → **no simple
  `k(o,m)` law**. The headline (wall breach + SL(5) k=2) stands and is strengthened; the closed form stays
  `NEEDS-SPECIALIST` with the correct object now identified (the geometric-stratum exponent). B157 FINDINGS
  corrected in place. Standalone character-variety math; firewall intact; P1–P16 untouched; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B197 — the figure-eight volume-tie broken by torsion-freeness (a verified chat2 increment) (2026-06-23; V189).**
  A cross-session (chat2) foundation-stress probe of the figure-eight Step-1 selection (C1), **independently
  re-derived** before banking. The bulk re-derives banked work (K016 criteria, P10 filters) — cited, not re-banked.
  **The one genuine increment:** P10's *unresolved* m003 volume-tie is **broken by torsion-freeness** — m003 carries
  ℤ/5 torsion (not a b++ bundle), so among torsion-free bundles the figure-eight is the **unique** volume minimum
  (verified over all 241 b++ bundles to length 10). Sharpens P10's volume filter. Framed per **V145** (trace-3 the
  *only* proof; volume "unique *given* torsion-free" — leans on the torsion-free locus, **not** an independent axis;
  the "prefer-simplicity" premise is permanent), so it **hardens C1 modestly**, not "independent overdetermination"
  (the chat2 headline overstated; the corrected reading is banked). Also: the chiral pair `b++RRL`/`b++RLL` —
  equal volume, opposite CS=±1/48. A one-line **P10 sharpening is proposed for owner approval** (not committed).

- **B193 — the SL(3) sealing / field-content scouts (Masterplan III, Track G) (2026-06-23; V188).** Closes Track G.
  **L8:** chirality (cyclic-palindrome block sequence, B128/B134) and the **SU(2)_k eigenvalue field** (B132) are
  **independent** — all four (chirality, field) combinations occur, so the field is the quantum mod-4 spin-content,
  not chirality (extends B133 across composition). **L10:** the field-fusion to `Q(ζ₁₂)=Q(√−3,i)` is a **quantum**
  (SU(2)_k) phenomenon (a silver block already reaches it), while the **classical** metallic seed trace-fields stay
  **disjoint** (`Q(√−3)∩Q(i)=Q`, exact). **L5/L6:** the non-metallic SL(3) sealing search is **scoped
  NEEDS-SPECIALIST** (the B137 method + SnapPy-gated trace fields = intricate numerics; the B192 lesson cautions
  against rushing it). Reinforces K015/K016 (field = quantum-group arithmetic, not chirality). Emergent
  quantum-topology / character-variety math (K010); firewalled, nothing to `CLAIMS.md`. `tests/test_b193_*` (2).
- **B191 — the formal 2-cusp connector (Masterplan III, Track F; H5-a) (2026-06-23; V187).** B185 capped the
  1-cusp metallic units at *pairs*, so `N≥3` needs a `≥2`-cusp **connector**. Computed at the trace-ring level: the
  κ-selection **nests** — a *coupling* connector (modeled by its internal mapping class `φ_c`,
  `boundary₂=φ_c(boundary₁)`) propagates leaf₁'s A-poly constraint into a **discrete** fork on leaf₂ (`T→9, S→16,
  ST→32`), while the **identity/uncoupled** connector gives a **continuum** (the control). Discrete-and-
  **proliferating** (grows with `φ_c`, never forced-unique), so the selection mechanism extends past B185's pair-cap
  to `N≥3` in principle; the B185 dim count agrees (`(1+2+1)−2·2 = 0`, discrete iff coupled). The **true geometric
  metallic 2-cusp 3-manifold connector** (existence, which `φ_c`) is the NEEDS-SPECIALIST residual. Closes Track F.

- **B196 + S037 — the entropy↔conformal-dimension bridge, and the firewalled cosmogony (2026-06-23; V186).**
  *Solid math (B196):* under Painlevé VI ↔ c=1 (Gamayun–Iorgov–Lisovyy), the metallic once-punctured-torus object
  is a **c=1 four-twist-field** (Δ=1/16) conformal block whose single nontrivial datum is the dimension of its
  (hyperbolic) bundle/time-monodromy, **`Δ = −(ln λ_m/π)² = −(topological entropy/2π)²`** — the object's *dynamics*
  dressed as a CFT dimension, dimensionless and non-unitary. Rests on the exact identity `λ_m²+1/λ_m² = m²+2`.
  Forces **no** physical content (c=1 trivially fixed; Δ dimensionless; no scale/mass); the precise PVI channel
  placement is the one NEEDS-SPECIALIST detail (the value is exact). *Firewalled speculation (`speculations/S037`):*
  the four-part dualism — object = form (a conformal block whose content is its own entropy); Higgs field = scale;
  bath = arrow; import = identity — three legs external (the wall). Negatives kept prominent (B169 time=modulus,
  B151/B167 scale=import, B189 the artifact warning): this **confirms relocation, does not breach**. Emergent

- **B192 — SL(n≥3) higher-rank Lyapunov spectra (Masterplan III, Track D; L20 deepened) (2026-06-22; V185).**
  Computed the *full* Lyapunov spectrum (QR-flag) of the metallic SL(n) transfer cocycle, turning V29 into a
  **measured property**. **A clean parity law:** the spectrum is **symmetric (symplectic) iff `n` is even** (defect
  n=2: 0.000, n=4: 0.003) and **asymmetric (non-Hermitian) iff `n` is odd** (n=3: 0.22, n=5: 0.11) — exactly
  tracking "a symplectic form exists iff `n` even" (V29). The even-`n` symmetry is **special to the metallic
  cocycle** (a generic SL(n) is asymmetric for all `n`: n=4 defect ≈0.52, `163×`) — so the metallic even-`n`
  cocycle is conjugate to a symplectic one (it *uses* the form), while odd-`n` is genuinely non-Hermitian. Spectrum
  sums to 0 (SL(n)); the bounded set + one golden tower scale persist. Rigorous higher-rank spectral theory stays
  NEEDS-SPECIALIST. Emergent non-Hermitian math (K010); firewalled, nothing to `CLAIMS.md`. `tests/test_b192_*` (2).
- **B189 — the Ω accretion causal-set dimension (Masterplan III, Track E; L21, FIREWALLED) (2026-06-22; V184).**
  Computed the Myrheim–Meyer ordering-fraction dimension of the Ω class DAG (B156/B159) — *and hunted the artifact*.
  The estimator (calibrated on Minkowski sprinklings, matches Meyer's `f(d)` to a few %) gives `d_MM ≈ 3.94` for the
  full poset — but it is a **generic graded-DAG / truncation artifact, not a spacetime dimension**: it **drifts**
  upward with truncation (`2.08→2.70→3.28→3.63→3.94` for `L≤6…10`, no convergence) **and** is **matched by a random
  graded-DAG null control** (`3.79±0.01`, same level sizes + edge counts). So the program's most over-readable
  number (a "4") is vacuous as physics — the firewall holds **by computation**, preempting any "Ω predicts 4D"
  over-read. L21 computed and closed firewalled; combinatorial-only, nothing to `CLAIMS.md`. `tests/test_b189_*` (2).
- **B190 — abstract iterated gluing (Masterplan III, Track F) (2026-06-22; V183).** Pushes B174's trace-ring gluing
  past B185's pair-cap, **in both directions**, to test whether iterating forces a *unique* selection. **It does
  not.** **Open** gluing proliferates — the fork-polynomial **degree** (a Bézout/resultant *upper bound*, not the
  geometric count) grows `T^k → 8+k` (linear in twists), swaps `~double` (S=16, ST=32); never collapses to 1, never
  empties. **Closed/loop** (over-determination = fixed points) collapses the continuum to a **finite discrete** set
  whose **total** count grows (ST→1, TST→2, STST→3, STSTST→4); the lone count-1 case (ST) is the **trivial** point
  `(2,2,2)` (MB12-vacuous), and the genuine non-trivial fixed points are **golden-field** `((√5−1)/2, …)` and
  **non-monotone** (seq `0,0,2,0` — appear at STST, vanish at STSTST). So selection-to-discrete **yes**,
  selection-to-forced-unique **no** — confirms B185 in the trace ring (both directions). The literal closed-loop
  3-manifold realization is multi-cusp = NEEDS-SPECIALIST. *(Two precision fixes applied post-merge after in-batch

- **B188 — the driven-dissipative metallic chain (Masterplan III, Track B) (2026-06-22; V182).** The genuinely
  **dissipative** (Lindblad) channel — **computed** the Liouvillian gap (slowest relaxation rate) of a dephasing
  metallic chain vs controls. **An inversion of the naive "criticality ⟹ gapless" guess:** the **localized**
  (Aubry–André) control is the near-gapless one (gap `~100×` smaller — localization ⟹ slow relaxation), while the
  permanently-critical metallic chain relaxes like an **extended** chain (gap `~` periodic). The gap decays to zero
  in the thermodynamic limit (diffusive — no finite emergent timescale) and is **homogeneous in the external rates**
  (`Δ(sH,sγ)=sΔ` exactly → no intrinsic scale). Completes the open-system trilogy B183/B187/B188 — a real but

  (single-particle) to the **interacting** case S036 left open — **computed** by exact diagonalization of a few
  fermions. B183's *thresholdless arrow* **persists with interactions**: the permanently-critical metallic chain's
  many-body real→complex (point-gap) threshold `g_c(U) ≈ 0` for all `U=0…4` (a two-body interaction opens **no**
  protective gap — slightly *more* fragile), while the Aubry–André localized control stays **protected** (finite
  `g_c ≈ 0.7–1.4`) at every `U`. Robust across `L=10–16`, 2–3 particles. The arrow is genuine but `g_c` is
  **dimensionless** and the arrow's **source is the externally-imposed openness** (not self-generated) → no scale,
  extends B183's firewall verdict to the many-body case. Thermodynamic-N driven/MBL regime = NEEDS-SPECIALIST.

  B165's *conditional* theorem for the off-axis κ<2 Cantor spectrum (L19): the hyperbolicity hypothesis is
  strengthened from **one** diagnostic (B163's MST) to **three independent** ones, the key one **validated on the
  Damanik–Gorodetski-proven κ>2 case**. The trace-map **escape rate** `γ` (a Bowen–Ruelle hyperbolicity signature:
  exponential escape ⟺ hyperbolic repeller) is `>0` off-axis (κ<2) exactly as on the proven κ>2 case and `≈0` on the
  κ=2 band (calibrator) — fixing B165's escape-contaminated naive ratio; robust to trapping radius and sampling.
  Plus **box-counting dimension** (off-axis `<` band, golden+silver), independent of the MST. Two *local* diagnostics

  that B182 left as "a constraint (gluing) phenomenon, multi-cusp NEEDS-SPECIALIST" — **computed** up to the genuine
  boundary. The constraint (gluing) side **genuinely selects**: cusp-gluing collapses each piece's character-variety
  *curve* (a continuum) to a **discrete** κ-fork (B174/B131) — the real ">1 building block" selection, unlike
  superposition which proliferates (B182). **But not to a forced-unique value:** the fork has size `>1`, **multiplies**
  under iteration (grows, B174), and is a topological invariant of the *freely-chosen* gluing data (unique-per-choice,
  choices proliferate). And the metallic units are **1-cusped** (SnapPy) → leaves in any gluing graph → `2(k−1)≤k` →
  all-unit interaction **caps at pairs** (a closed κ-fork); `N≥3` needs `≥2`-cusp **connectors** that are *not*
  once-punctured-torus bundles = the genuine **NEEDS-SPECIALIST** boundary. The dimension count `dim = Σcusps −
  2·gluings ≥ 0` (closed → `0`, discrete) shows no forced point. So **selection-to-discrete: yes; selection-to-unique:
  no** — neither channel forces uniqueness; this sharpens B182 into a computed boundary. Emergent character-variety /

- **B184 — the symmetry / gauge door (S036 hunt 4) (2026-06-22; V178).** Does the interaction of multiple units
  **force** a symmetry (a gauge group)? **No — computed, not asserted.** Each unit has a *forced* symmetry: the
  modular **SL(2,ℤ)** duality (B150 — real, but a *duality* not the SM gauge group) and a self-similarity
  **inflation** `×λ_m` = the companion `[[m,1],[1,0]] ∈ GL(2,ℤ)`. But the interaction of *distinct-field* units
  **breaks** the global inflation (the cross-product `α₁α₂` escapes the rank-3 module; the dilation factors
  `λ₁,λ₂` are multiplicatively independent) and only **multiplies** the per-unit dualities — a product that
  **proliferates** with N (mirrors B182), not a selected Lie/gauge group. Same-field units keep a *shared*
  inflation (`α₁α₄=2−3α₁`, field-not-count). So the **gauge** content stays **free input** (the S036 null), now
  computed. **Unifying fact across B182/B184:** the *same* distinct-field / cross-product-escape arithmetic that
  grows the gap-label rank (B182) is what breaks the inflation symmetry (B184) — proliferation and symmetry-breaking
  are two faces of one fact. Emergent quasicrystal/character-variety symmetry math (K010); firewalled, nothing to

- **B183 — the open / driven collective arrow door (S036 hunt 3) (2026-06-22; V177).** The last untested arrow/scale
  door B181 left open ("an *open/driven* large-N collective"), **computed, not deferred.** Two naive PT probes are
  artifacts (a halves-split gives `max|Im|=γ` trivially; a staggered ±iγ gives `γ_c→0` for any `V≠0` — a
  **chiral-symmetry** artifact, not localization). The discriminating, theorem-backed probe is the **Hatano–Nelson**
  imaginary gauge field under PBC: the real spectrum goes complex (a non-unitary, **irreversible** point gap = an
  arrow) at `g_c = min` Lyapunov over the spectrum = the inverse localization length. **Result — the same inversion
  as B181:** the metallic collective is **thresholdless** (`g_c≈0`, since permanently critical, B181) — it gains an
  irreversible spectrum under the *slightest* drive; criticality = **maximal fragility** to the arrow, not robustness.
  A localized control (AA `V=8cos`, off-metallic) is **protected** up to the *exact* finite `g_c=ln4=1.386`. **The
  firewall holds:** the arrow is genuine (unlike combinatorial Ω, B168 / reversible trace map, B177) but `g_c` is
  **dimensionless** (no scale) and the arrow's **source is external** (the openness is input — not self-generated).
  So the **ARROW** ingredient upgrades to "emergent in the open collective, thresholdless, dimensionless, externally
  sourced"; **SCALE** stays external. Permanent criticality is **double-edged** — it *is* the scale-freeness (`ξ→∞`)
  **and** the zero-threshold arrow-fragility (`g_c=0`). Validated against exact `ln4`; controls pass. Emergent
  non-Hermitian/localization math (K010); firewalled, nothing to `CLAIMS.md`. `tests/test_b183_*` (3).
- **B182 — the selection / multiplicity door (S036 hunt 2) (2026-06-19; V176).** The direct answer to "2 / more /
  set / infinity of units?" for the **superposition (weaving)** channel: it **proliferates**, it does **not**
  select-to-unique. PSLQ shows weaving `N` distinct-field metallic units gives a gap-label module of **rank `1+N`**
  (→ ∞ as N→∞); it's the number of **distinct fields** that grows it, not the unit count (same-field `m=1,4` are
  dependent, `−1+2α₁−α₄=0`). **The fence:** selection-to-*unique* is a **constraint** (gluing/over-determination)
  phenomenon — finite κ-fork pairwise (K014/B174), over-determined when iterated — multi-cusp **NEEDS-SPECIALIST**;
  superposition only enriches. And the proliferating structure stays dimensionless + scale-free (B181). So "infinity
  of units" → infinitely rich, still scale-free; SELECTION-uniqueness stays open on the constraint side. Pure
  arithmetic (K010); firewalled, nothing to `CLAIMS.md`. `tests/test_b182_*` (2).
- **S036 + B181 — the search specification, and its first hunt (the criticality scale-door) (2026-06-19; V175).**
  **`speculations/S036`** (firewalled, POSTULATED) is the **search specification** prompted by the reframe *"the ToE
  emerges from the interaction of multiple units, not the single one — clarify what we're searching for so we
  recognize a result and don't bypass it."* It registers each physics ingredient with **what would count** as it
  emerging from interaction and **the null to reject** (the MB12 vacuity-check at program scale): the *form*
  ingredients are present/emergent; the *content* ingredients (scale, arrow, selection-uniqueness, gauge, masses) are
  external/dead at single+pair, with **multiplicity (N→∞)** the untested lever. **`B181`** runs the first hunt — the
  **large-N / criticality** scale-door — and finds an **inversion:** the metallic quasicrystal is **permanently
  critical** (Lyapunov γ≈0 on the spectrum at *all* coupling — no metal–insulator transition, vs the Aubry–André
  control which localizes at λ>2 with γ=ln(λ/2)). Permanent criticality ⟹ `ξ→∞` ⟹ scale-invariant ⟹ **scale-free
  *by* criticality** — so criticality *explains* the scale-freeness rather than providing a scale; a finite emergent
  length needs *breaking* criticality (off the metallic class) and is *dimensionless* (lattice units → external). The
  scale-search points to the Hitchin/Higgs side; open = an *open/driven* large-N collective. Emergent criticality math

- **B180 — the two-faces dictionary: one hinge quantity + two analogous operations (2026-06-19; V174;
  understand-completely #5).** Resolves "is *two faces of one principle* (K019) an identity or an analogy?" →
  **a sharpening.** **C1:** `κ = tr[A,B]` is the *same conserved number* on both faces — the character-variety
  boundary coordinate *and* the trace-map invariant (the Dehn-twist trace maps conserve κ, symbolic). **C2 [live]:**
  κ's value sets the spectral type — coupling 0 (periodic) → full band (0 gaps), κ>2 → Cantor (13 gaps); so the
  character-variety κ **governs** the spectral face (the real bridge, K010). **C3 [fence, MB12]:** the two
  *interaction operations* — cusp-gluing (bundle κ-fork) vs potential-weaving (gap labels) — are **distinct math
  with distinct outputs** (trace values vs IDS fractions), sharing only the signature single=continuum/distinct=structure.
  The naive "κ-fork = gap labels" is **false**. K019 sharpened (no retraction). Emergent topology/spectral math (K010);
  firewalled, nothing to `CLAIMS.md`. `tests/test_b180_*` (2).
- **B179 — the metallic "numbers" unified: one object, several views (2026-06-19; V173; understand-completely #3).**
  Pure symbolic algebra. The whole geometric/arithmetic tower of a metallic seed `m` is **one algebraic object** —
  `λ_m = (m+√(m²+4))/2`, the root of `x²−mx−1` — and every number we carry is an exact function of it: the gap-label
  frequency `1/λ_m`, the bundle trace `m²+2 = λ_m²+λ_m⁻²`, the dynamical degree `λ_m²`, the field `ℚ(√(m²+4))`, the
  Hurwitz constant `1/√(m²+4) = 1/(λ_m+1/λ_m)`, the tower eigenvalues `±λ_m^k`. Bridge identities: `λ_m ± 1/λ_m =
  √(m²+4)` resp. `m`. **Honest boundary (MB12):** three same-named parameters are **distinct** and must not be
  conflated with `λ_m` — the Schrödinger coupling `λ` (free knob), the Fricke modular `λ̃` in `κ=λ̃+1/λ̃` (a free
  character-variety coordinate), and the gap-labeling IDS (a derived combination). Golden `m=1` collapses the tower to
  `φ`. No new claim; pure algebra of what we have. `tests/test_b179_*` (4).
- **B178 — the perturbative mechanism: the width law + golden privilege are ONE textbook thing (2026-06-18; V172;
  understand-completely consolidation).** Identifies the single perturbative mechanism behind both flagships: the
  combination gap `(n₁,n₂)` is the order-`|n₁|+|n₂|` term, ∝ `λ₁^{|n₁|}λ₂^{|n₂|}`, Diophantine-robust — *order* gives
  the width law (B175), the *Diophantine factor* gives the golden privilege (B176). Introduces the **contamination-
  robust index method** (gap pinned to its gap-labeling eigenvalue index) and confirms the **per-frequency structure**
  (power-1 clean; (2,1)/(1,2) carry a distinct higher power ~1.7). **Honest limit:** the exact integer (=2) is
  textbook but numerically **plateaus at ~1.7** (saturation + finite-N), not cleanly resolved in-sandbox →
  NEEDS-SPECIALIST. Golden privilege = a Diophantine-amplification heuristic. **A multi-step verify-don't-trust
  record:** a window-max "derivation" was wrong → over-hastily called a "failure" → an owner challenge surfaced that
  the window-max *can* contaminate → the index method confirmed the structure and showed the power-2 shortfall is
  *genuine saturation, not contamination* → an intermediate "B175 is contaminated" alarm was itself **walked back**
  (B175 stands). Both over-claim directions corrected. Emergent quasicrystal math (K010); firewalled, nothing to
  `CLAIMS.md`; B175/B176 unchanged. `tests/test_b178_*` (3).
- **B177 — the metabolism test, "is it alive?" H3 to the knife (2026-06-18; V171; S035 register, firewalled).**
  The decisive test of a cross-session ("chat2") life-hunt: does κ>2 order **starve** when you stop feeding the
  chain (a self-maintaining *cell*), or is it conserved/frozen (a *crystal*)? **Verdict: a conservative
  active-chaotic CRYSTAL/HORSESHOE, not a cell.** **C1** κ (the Fricke–Vogt first integral) is **conserved** across
  generations (drift <1e-8) — cannot starve (H3 original form dead by the conservation law). **C2** the real
  Sturmian gap **converges/freezes** (1.0653, |Δw|→1e-4) — held by static *structure*, not *flux*; doesn't close
  (H3 revised form dead — a conservative spectral problem has no metabolism). **C3** the trace map is **invertible**
  (no arrow). **C4** there *is* an active set (the κ>2 horseshoe, cited B163/B165) but it's reversible chaos — *order
  that wanders, not order that maintains itself*. So metabolism/homeostasis/arrow **relocate external** (K018 in the
  life register); "heredity already owned" is an over-read (κ-conservation is a symmetry, not heredity). *Verify-
  don't-trust:* my own C4 divergence demo was escape-contaminated (B165's recorded lesson) → replaced by the cited
  clean result. Firewalled; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`. `tests/test_b177_*` (4).
- **K019 — the collective (multibody) metallic spectrum (2026-06-18; multibody-extraction plan P4).** The
  textbook-layer **synthesis** of the multi-seed arc (B171–B176), companion to K007/K010 (the single chain). The
  one-line result: *a lone unit only parametrizes; structure no single unit has appears only with interaction of
  distinct units, and it is predictable.* Consolidates the **two faces** (spectral combination gap ↔ character-variety
  κ-fork), the **two-number predictability** (heights exact by gap-labeling; widths by the weak-coupling order-power
  law), the **golden privilege** (φ stands alone), the **model caveat** (heights universal, openings potential-dependent),
  and the honest physics-contact statement (both genuine contacts are *collective*; predictivity over structure, not
  constants). INDEX + ARCHITECTURE bumped to K019. No new claims (explainer); nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B176 — the golden privilege, with controls (2026-06-18; V170; multibody-extraction plan P3).** Controlled test
  of a cross-session ("chat2") claim that the woven chain "dresses the most irrational resonance." **Confirms-yet-
  corrects:** **φ/golden is genuinely privileged** — its combination satellite ladder dominates *both* silver's (8.9×
  cosine, 3.3× Sturmian) and bronze's (3.4×), θ-averaged, in **both** models, and **not** because golden has a wider
  bare gap (ladder ratio 8.9× ≫ principal-width ratio 1.6×). **But it is golden-stands-alone, NOT a monotone order**
  — silver and bronze are comparable (s/b 1.5/0.77), so it does *not* continue golden>silver>bronze. The
  golden=most-irrational=most-robust math is real (Hurwitz/KAM); the P000-anchor tie is a one-way **`[RHYME]`** with a
  real kernel, not a derivation; the effect is cosine-dominant; a rigorous theorem is NEEDS-SPECIALIST. Emergent

- **B175 — the collective spectrum is two-number predictable (2026-06-18; V169; multibody-extraction plan P1+P2).**
  The disciplined version of a cross-session ("chat2") "combination ridge." The woven metallic spectrum is
  predictable from two pairs of numbers: **`(α₁,α₂)` fix every gap *height* exactly** at all couplings (gap-labeling,
  seed-robust across golden+silver & golden+bronze, label-error ~8e-5), and **`(λ₁,λ₂)` fix every gap *width*** via
  the order-power law `width ~ λ^(|n₁|+|n₂|)` **at weak coupling** (order-2 slope **1.92/2.01**, order-3 →3). So four
  numbers forecast the whole weak-coupling spectrum — a **collective** phenomenon (the single unit has no combination
  gaps). **Bound (once):** the width law is **perturbative** — it saturates at strong coupling; predictivity over
  **structure**, not a fundamental constant. **Model distinction (reconciles B172/B173, corrects the over-reach):**
  the ridge **opens in the cosine (bichromatic) model** (0.211) but is **~closed in the metallic Sturmian chain**
  (0.016) — heights are potential-independent (the theorem), *which* gaps open is potential-dependent. **3

  **character-variety companion** to the spectral multi-seed arc (B171–B173). Extends B131 (identity gluing) and
  B134 (one swap) to the gluing-map landscape via the abelian peripheral trace ring `(p,q,r)` and the mapping-class
  action. **Validation:** identity glue `(1,1)`→CONTINUUM, `(1,2)`→`{−4,−2}` (B131); swap fig-8 self-glue →
  `p=f(f(p))` degree 16 (B134). **Landscape:** CONTINUUM only on the measure-zero curve-aligned locus
  (identity/same-seed); **discrete for every nontrivial φ**, the fork size φ-dependent — **multiplies under swaps**
  (S→16, ST→32) and grows slowly under twists (T→9, T²→10); finiteness = Kitano–Nozaki Bézout. **Cross-face
  agreement:** same principle as B171–B173 — interaction of *distinct* units forces structure no single unit has
  (spectral combination gap ↔ character-variety κ-fork). **H5 → CHARACTERIZED.** Scope: pairwise only (once-cusp);

- **B173 — the gap-labeling reduction, Phase 2 (2026-06-18; V167; multi-seed plan, L16).** Reduces B172's
  combination gap to the **gap-labeling theorem** (a citable consequence, not a new claim) and **confirms the L16
  rank formula**. For the 1D superposition operator the gap-label group is the **frequency module ℤ+ℤα_g+ℤα_s —
  rank 3, product-free** (Johnson–Moser 1982; Bellissard; Damanik–Fillman 2022, arXiv:2203.03696). **R1/R2 (PSLQ):**
  golden+silver have no integer relation → rank 3, and the *full* L16 formula `rank = 1 + #distinct quadratic fields`
  is confirmed (distinct fields → 3; same-field golden m=1 & m=4 → dependent `−1+2α₁−α₄=0` → caps at 2). **R3:** the
  product α_g·α_s is a genuine 4th direction that the 1D theorem **excludes** (products are a ℤ^d≥2 / 2D-tiling
  feature — Elliott 1984, Forrest–Hunton–Kellendonk) ⟹ L16's **√(dᵢdⱼ) worry is dispelled**. **Novelty (tiered):**
  the mechanism is **KNOWN** (not claimed); the explicit golden+silver construction **APPEARS-NOVEL** as a worked

  — *does heterogeneous interaction generate a rank-3 combination gap?* — **affirmatively (hedged)**. **C1:** the
  woven metallic quasicrystal has a **real, persistent** spectral gap (in-gap to N=128 000, width 0.114) whose IDS
  (≈0.6114, via the exact Sturm/pivot count) is **not any single-frequency ladder value** — ≥8× closer to the
  combination label (3,−3) than to the nearest single-freq value of any order ⟹ it needs **both** frequencies ⟹
  **interaction-born** (a rank-3 feature no single seed has). **Honest limit:** the IDS plateaus at the finite-size
  floor (~2e-4); the *specific* label is consistent with (3,−3) but a sharp many-digit certification is
  **NEEDS-SPECIALIST**. **C2:** bilingual inheritance is **seed-robust** (3 metallic pairs); small-label combination
  gaps essentially **absent** (one non-robust golden+bronze (1,−2) hit) — the combination structure lives at larger
  labels. *Verify-don't-trust (3rd self-correction):* the probe's first-draft "clean convergence to (3,−3)" was

  only ratios, so the firewall would **dissolve** not relocate. **L1 [structural]:** **undecidable from within** —
  the Machian and external readings give the **same** dimensionless math; no internal computation distinguishes
  them (interpretive, not a calculation). **L2 [num, null-test]:** the only predictive form is **value-matching**,
  which is **dead** — the program's φ²/metallic/`log 2` numbers match observed constants (`α⁻¹`, `m_p/m_e`, …) no
  better than a **random** base (median exponent-distance-to-integer 0.258 vs 0.251 — indistinguishable; the S014

  degree = φ²" was refuted by the numerics (orbit-norm growth ≠ dynamical degree) and removed. **Deferred to PR2:**
  the OPT↔(0,4) cover dictionary (→ degree `λ_m²` per metallic m), the isomonodromy **flow**, and the
  firewall-relocation verdict. Standalone dynamics math; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`. `tests/test_b164_*` (3).
- **B167 — the conserved ⟹ no-internal-scale lemma (the firewall, stated) (2026-06-18; V158).** P3 of Masterplan II.
  Sharpens the POSTULATED §8a five-door map + B148/B151/P010 into a **stated structural argument**: a
  conserved/topological first integral (`κ`) of a measure-preserving map **does not run ⟹ cannot source a
  dimensionful scale from within**; a scale enters only by **external import** (door 4 — the θ-angle pattern, the
  non-vacuity witness). Backbone **[exact]** (re-derived fresh: `κ` conserved by the Dehn twists + `φ_{1,2,3}`;
  dimensionless; MB6/MB12 control + witness). Five-door taxonomy **POSTULATED (argued complete)**. Independently
  **adversarially red-teamed** (6th-door stress test — holography/backreaction/Casimir/modular-weight/regulator/
  adiabatic — each reduces to door 1/4/5; firewall/scoping/tiering pass). **Firewall-side**: no scale, no Λ, no
  crossing; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; stays POSTULATED. Betti↔Hitchin grounding deferred to a post-P1 PR.

- **B163 — the κ-sweep resolved: the κ<2 spectrum is a Cantor set; no figure-eight encoding (2026-06-18; V157).**
  Resolves the two open items B162 left (L19), each with a control / null-test. **(3a) [num, control-bracketed]:**
  the non-Hermitian κ<2 spectrum is a **genuine Cantor set (totally disconnected)**, not a curve — the largest
  spectral gap (max MST edge / diameter) **converges to a positive constant** across F=144→1597, tracking the
  κ>2 known-Cantor control (~0.16) and the opposite of the κ=2 full-band control (→0). Upgrades B162's
  "thin/zero-area" to "Cantor". **(3b) [num, negative + null-test]:** **no spectral encoding** of the figure-eight
  geometry — every feature is smooth through κ=−2 (no kink at the cusp-opening) and no figure-eight invariant
  (vol, √−3, 2/φ) matches specially there (neighbors equal/better). The figure-eight link is the **boundary trace
  κ=−2 alone** (B160), not the spectrum — the "spectrum deforms into hyperbolic geometry" reading is refuted at
  the spectral level. **(3a)-as-theorem stays OPEN** (no ground truth off the real axis). Firewalled; nothing to
  `CLAIMS.md`. `tests/test_b163_*` (2).
- **B162 — the κ-sweep: κ=2 is the unique cancellation↔non-cancellation wall (2026-06-18; V156).**
  The geometric face of the non-cancellation obstruction (S034/B161). The figure-eight monodromy foliated over
  `κ=2+λ²` has a spectrum that is **positive-measure only at κ=2** (the full AC band, `|σ|=4.000` — the
  trivial/cancellation vacuum) and **zero-measure everywhere else**: a real **Cantor** set for κ>2
  (4.000→1.817→0.706→0.097) and a **thin** complex set for κ<2 (2D area→0; lift-off `max|Im E|≈0.91μ`). Method =
  self-validated finite-chain diagonalization (V1 Hermitian sanity, V2 bulk BC-robustness, V3 size convergence,
  V4 chiral `E↔−Ē`). κ=−2 endpoint = figure-eight cusp (λ=2i, parabolic commutator, symbolic). **OPEN** (no
  ground truth off the real axis): whether the κ<2 thin set is a true Cantor set, and whether κ=−2 encodes the
  hyperbolic geometry. A **mathematical bridge, not a crossing** (both ends established — Sütő, Thurston);
  nothing to `CLAIMS.md`. `tests/test_b162_*` (3). Promotes `OPEN_LEADS` L19.
- **B161 — the cancellation-locus stratification: the non-cancellation obstruction, as math (2026-06-18; V155).**
  Math infrastructure for the spine `speculations/S034`. Reframes the dead "does κ source a Λ value?" into "is exact
  cancellation structurally non-generic?". **R1 [exact]:** the cancellation locus κ=2 (commuting/abelian/periodic) is
  **codim-1 / measure-zero** — `{κ=2}` a single hypersurface; κ **free** on the φ_m fixed locus (κ-elimination empty,
  re-derived m=2,4, *not* `sp.solve`); commuting pairs measure-zero (null-test, generic to non-abelian dynamics, the
  metallic family not special); MB12 abelian control κ≡2 (falsifiable). **R2 [exact]+[num]+[proved]:** cancellation is
  the **trivial** fiber (κ=2 ⟺ λ=0 = free Laplacian, full band [−2,2] measure 4), non-cancellation **fractures** it
  (κ>2 measure 4.000→1.817→0.706→0.097; MB6 control); Ω-cone analogue B156 entropy 0 vs log 2. **Reconciliation:**
  *the value is free* (B130) vs *the zero is non-generic* (here) — **refutes fine-tuning, NOT "forced/empty"** (κ=2
  attained). Pure MATH, firewalled (physics reading in S034 only); nothing to `CLAIMS.md`. `tests/test_b161_*` (5).
  Formalizes `OPEN_LEADS` L17.
- **B160 — the metallic-quasicrystal bridge: independent rediscovery + bronze + the κ-sweep lead (2026-06-17; V154).**
  A fresh cross-session worker (no repo access) re-derived `κ = tr[A,B] = 2+λ²` → the Fibonacci-Hamiltonian
  quasicrystal → zero-measure Cantor spectrum, and converged on the **identical bridge-not-crossing firewall**.
  Verify-don't-trust finding: the **entire bridge is already banked** (B107/A, B148/V137, K007, K010, B124, B127,
  S023) — **corroboration, not new physics**. Verified increments: the explicit transfer-matrix proof
  (`z=xy−2 ⟹ tr[A,B]=2+λ²`, E-independent, symbolic); an **independent bronze (m=3)** trace map (Cayley–Hamilton)
  conserving the Fricke invariant with a zero-measure Cantor spectrum (ratio ~0.719); and the **κ-sweep** lead —
  one foliated monodromy from the quasicrystal (κ>2, K007) to the **figure-eight hyperbolic point** (κ=−2 ⟺ λ=2i,
  parabolic commutator, B67), the κ<2 middle left **OPEN**. Emergent/condensed-matter math, **bridge not crossing**;
  nothing to `CLAIMS.md`. Reproducers + `tests/test_b160_quasicrystal_bridge.py` (5 passed).
- **B159 — the Ω strict-full class-graded DAG L4–L10, independently verified (2026-06-17; V153).**
  A cross-session "gate2 class DAG export" (the charpoly-class–graded transition graph of the Ω strict-full cone,
  L4–L10) ingested and **independently verified**: full L4–L10 conservation/structure (classes 1,2,6,18,49,115,283;
  histories 96→2 488 080; matrices 36→65 472), **every one of the 474 classes reciprocal** (TC-2 cone-wide), the
  L4 **seed = Ω₄ = B155**, and a **from-scratch re-enumeration** reproducing L4–L7 class-by-class and edge-by-edge.
  Metallic spectra (figure-eight T=3, silver T=6, bronze T=11) appear as reciprocal factors. The Myrheim–Meyer /
  causal-set "Gate-2" reading is **firewalled** (the export itself disclaims a manifold verdict). Reproducer +
  `tests/test_b159_omega_class_dag.py` (6 passed).
- **B158 — the Ω↔tower bridge audit: a spectral-only correspondence (2026-06-17; V152).**
  Resolves the open lead **L18**. The Ω charpoly factors into reciprocal quadratics with the exact relation
  **`(p−2)(q−2) = −2(m+1)`**, and **every metallic bundle-monodromy charpoly `x²−T_M x+1`** (`T_M=M²+2` =
  3,6,11,18,…) is realized as a reciprocal factor of the integer Ω family **on the live cone** (signature
  (1,3)) — the figure-eight (T=3)×Φ₆ is Ω₄=B155, the **silver (T=6)×Φ₆ is the integer point `R_{7,1}`**.
  **But** the strict-full shears commute (`A·C=C·A`), so there is **no faithful mechanism** and no functional
  `κ↦δ` pullback. **Verdict:** Ω is the **abelianized *spectral* image** of the metallic tower (monodromy
  spectra realized as Ω reciprocal factors at lattice points), not its dynamics — sharpening B156's qualitative
  "abelianized shadow" to a precise positive statement. MATH tier; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.
- **B157 — the metallic degree=rank exponent: `k=4−m(o−3)` REFUTED; order-not-rank survives (2026-06-17; V151).**
  Phase 2 (derive the "metallic A-polynomial" exponent), a two-route workflow (B67 eliminant + B89 ideal
  algebra) with adversarial synthesis — the adversary (high confidence) couldn't break it and strengthened the
  SL(4)-emptiness leg. **Headline (a self-correction):** the empirically-banked closed form **`k = 4 − m(o−3)`
  is REFUTED** — extending to **bronze (m=3)** gives genuine non-degenerate counterexamples `(3,4)→k=3` (formula
  predicts 1) and `(3,6)→k=1` (predicts −5); it was an artifact of m∈{1,2}, and no ≤3-parameter law fits the
  corrected grid. **What survives** (the hedged part of B154): `k` is **order-determined, rank-independent**
  (`o=3 ⇒ k=4` at n=3 and n=4). **New exact figure-eight cells:** `o=3→4` over ℚ(ω) and **`o=4→3` over ℚ(i)**
  (`[A,B]=c·µ³`, two ways). **New machinery:** the general-m bundle system + the exact identity
  `φ_m([A,B])=Aᵐ[A,B]A⁻ᵐ` ⟹ cusp meridian `µ=A⁻ᵐt` for all m. **SL(4) `{1,1,i,−i}` (o=4) provably empty**
  (Lemma 1: `det(UR)·det(LL)` in the bundle ideal over ℚ(i); reducible). Corrects **B154/V146** in place. MATH
  tier; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.
- **B156 completion — source-chat cross-check + TC-1/TC-4 + the commuting-shears scope (2026-06-16; V150).**
  The owner supplied the **source reasoning** (the ChatGPT/Ω chat that produced the work, which itself ingested
  the ~1085pp AI trace — the two chats cross-examined each other). An agent cross-check + fresh re-derivation
  here: **(1)** confirmed B156 is faithful (our re-derivations even strengthen the source) and that history
  entropy **log 2** is final (it supersedes the older `(1/3)log 7` bound); **(2)** banked two missed theorems,
  each re-derived (not transcribed) — **TC-1** [exact]: Ω₄ is the *unique minimal* strict-full seed (minimal
  level L=4; every strict-full L4 history has charpoly (4,5,4)=golden×phase), and **TC-4** [proved]: an
  orientation *no-go* (relabel-closed ensembles have zero net Pfaffian residual — orientation is boundary-induced,
  the rigorous core of "non-cancellation"); **(3)** the decisive scope — **Ω is the abelianized shadow of the
  trace-map tower, not its mechanism**: the strict-full shears `A=S₀₃, C=S₂₃` **commute**, so `R↦A, L↦C` cannot
  represent the noncommutative monodromy; the Ω↔tower **bridge audit** (κ↦δ/det G? χ_Ω↦Dickson?) is the open
  frontier (`docs/OPEN_LEADS.md` L18), never run; **(4)** the independent heavy re-run re-confirmed the **full
  strict-full count tower L4–L10 = 96/672/3840/20928/105312/521904/2488080** (state-propagation, fresh code),
  matching the handoff artifacts at every level — Phase 1 closed. Updated `frontier/B156`,
  `docs/UNIFIED_STATE.md`, PC18. MATH tier; firewall
  intact; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **B156 — the Ω strict-full cone: full integration of the cross-session Ω program, Phase 1 (2026-06-16; V149).**
  Banks the **Ω-specific** content (the SL(4) lift of P6) onto current main, with **all four Ω theorems
  independently re-derived + adversarially verified** (a 4-claim workflow with skeptics; 4/4 confirmed, none
  refuted): **(1)** core R/G algebra — `R_{a,m} ∈ SL(4,ℤ)`, `det R=1`, palindromic
  `χ = x⁴−ax³+(2a−2m−4)x²−ax+1`, `RᵀGR=G`, `det G=−δ/(m+1)`, shears `A:δ→δ+2`/`C:δ→δ−1`, signature **(1,3)**
  on the live cone (wall `δ=0` → (1,2,1); (2,2) below) — constancy *rigorous* (det `G<0` + Sylvester pivot
  certificate); **(2)** TC-2 — strict-full ⟹ reciprocal char poly; **(3)** the **Fibonacci** block-count
  (`F_{n+1}`, growth `φ`); **(4)** wall-avoiding **history entropy = log 2** (exact: `W_n(δ) ~ (1−φ^{−δ})·2ⁿ`).
  Strict-full **survivor counts** L4–L7 = 96/672/3840/20928 re-confirmed by **two** from-scratch enumerators
  (exact `det` test, with/without the reciprocity shortcut); L8–L10 = 105312/521904/2488080 from artifacts,
  independent re-run in progress. **Verify-don't-trust payoff:** the handoff's own brute-force script counts
  strict-full *per char-poly class* and **over-counts** (L5: 3120 vs the true 672) — the correct count is
  *per-matrix*; a 40 hr blind run of that script would have computed the wrong quantity. Also caught + fixed a
  TC-2 exposition imprecision. Firewall claim-boundary table copied **verbatim**; signature (1,3) = algebraic
  inertia, entropy = word-growth, **no physics**. Expert one-page note → `papers/omega_strict_full_note/`

- **`docs/UNIFIED_STATE.md` — the cross-branch "Unified State of Knowledge" brief banked (2026-06-16).**
  A single source of truth across **Branch A** (trace-map / character variety, this repo) and **Branch B** (the Ω
  history-enumeration handoff), privacy-cleaned (generic source labels; math branch names kept) and status-labelled.
  Carries a **verify-don't-trust banner**: Branch A is banked/tested here (B1–B155, V1–V148); Branch B is a *separate*
  handoff program whose B-numbering (B206…B907) is distinct, of which only the **core Ω₄/TC-1 theorem** has been
  independently re-derived in-sandbox (counts, TC-2, history-entropy `log 2` are `[confirm-with-Ω-handoff]`).
  Records the **B-number bridge** (Ω-side "B206" = this repo's `frontier/B155`) and folds in the V148 sharpening of the
  B206 ≅ Ω₄ unification (shared canonical object — same charpoly + signature + ℚ-conjugacy class; the integer Ω family
  reaches the charpoly only at half-integer `m=−1/2`, so not a common integer lattice point). Firewall preserved;
  nothing to `CLAIMS.md`.
- **PC17 — "Two Results from the Metallic Trace-Map Program" external-review note banked (2026-06-16).**
  A specialist-facing consolidation (`papers/metallic_trace_map_note/`, privacy-cleaned, status-labelled) of three
  standalone results: **A** `L=−M⁴` on the figure-eight SL(4) spectrum-pinned *slice* + completeness (the honest,
  corrected scope of the deflated PC13 "component"); **B** `κ=2+λ²` (the trace map *is* the Fibonacci–Hamiltonian
  trace map); **C** the "golden × phase" rational spectral bridge at n=4 (= `frontier/B155`). Registered as PC17 in
  `papers/CANDIDATES.md`. Results A/B repackage banked repo work; only C (B155) is new. Novelty of A/C is
  NEEDS-SPECIALIST; §5 firewall load-bearing.
- **B155 — the "golden × phase" spectral bridge at n=4 (2026-06-16; V148).**
  Processing an external-review note (Result C) + an AI-assisted cross-session synthesis (the "Ω" history-enumeration
  program) one-by-one through governance, each **independently re-derived** before banking. A single integer matrix
  `M_g = [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,1,1,1],[1,1,0,1]] ∈ SL(4,ℤ)` realizes **"figure-eight monodromy × order-6 phase"**
  as a rational block structure: `charpoly(M_g) = (x²−3x+1)(x²−x+1)` — the *golden* factor (figure-eight monodromy
  trace poly, disc 5, root φ², real/Anosov) times the *phase* factor (`Φ₆`, disc −3, finite order 6). It is ℚ-similar
  to `[[2,1],[1,1]] ⊕ [[0,1],[−1,1]]` and nonderogatory; it glues the two invariant 2-planes inside ℤ⁴ with cokernel
  **(ℤ/2)²** (class-specific — the block-diagonal form with the same χ has trivial glue); and it carries an invariant
  symmetric form of **signature (1,3)** with discriminant **−15 = disc ℚ(√5)·disc ℚ(√−3)**. **B206 ≅ Ω₄, honestly
  scoped:** the Ω positive-shear family `R_{a,m}` reaches this characteristic polynomial only at the *half-integer*
  point `a=4, m=−1/2`, so the bridge is the **shared canonical object** (same charpoly + signature + ℚ-conjugacy
  class), not a common integer lattice point. **Firewall:** signature (1,3) = algebraic inertia of a bilinear form,
  **not** spacetime; no physics claim. MATH tier; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.
- **B154 — the metallic meridian `µ=A⁻ᵐt` and the order-based degree=rank exponent (silver bundle; 2026-06-16; V146–V147).**
  Phase C of the B153 campaign (does degree=rank generalize from the figure-eight m=1 to the silver bundle m=2, R²L²?).
  **(1) The metallic meridian:** `µ=A⁻ᵐt`, derived from the exact free-group identity `φ_m([A,B])=Aᵐ[A,B]A⁻ᵐ` (the
  monodromy fixes the fiber boundary up to conjugacy; the figure-eight's `A⁻¹t` is the m=1 case). **(2) degree=rank
  GENERALIZES** to the metallic family: with `µ=A⁻ᵐt` the matrix identity `[A,B]=±µᵏ` holds for silver too — so it is
  *not* figure-eight-special. **(3) The exponent is ORDER-based, not rank-based** — "degree=rank" (`k=n`) is a
  coincidence of the principal spectra (B95 ties their order to the rank); the decisive test is that figure-eight
  `{1,ω,ω²}` (order 3) gives `k=4` at *both* n=3 and n=4. Closed-form fit **`k=4−m(o−3)`** (o = boundary-spectrum
  order) on all accessible points; `k` is the A-polynomial slope. **(4) Geometry:** the silver `{1,ω,ω²}`@SL3 locus
  is a fixed-spectrum component (codim 0) that is an A-free slice (tr A moves) — the figure-eight n=4 pattern.
  A first-principles *derivation* of `k=4−m(o−3)` is open (the metallic A-polynomial, the B67→B89 program generalized).
  Several verify-don't-trust self-corrections along the way (best-rep over-read → wrong-meridian → derived positive;
  "slice"→ the precise component/slice deformation theory). Also: the **lean self-audit workflow completed** (V147) —
  48/50 confirmed, only P10/P12 flagged (both already handled; it reversed its own P12 verdict), 2 minor honesty
  caveats applied. MATH tier; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.
- **B153 — the rank-stratified degeneration of degree=rank + a self-scrutiny campaign that corrected merged work (2026-06-15; V142–V145).**
  Replaces the deflated PC13 "SL(4) figure-eight A-polynomial component" with the honest, stronger result: the figure-eight
  degree=rank relation `L=(−1)^{n-1}Mⁿ` is **rank-stratified** — a genuine SL(n,ℂ) character-variety **component at n=3**
  (`L=+M³`, Falbel; **now exact over F_p**, 3 primes: geometric dim-5 component tangent 11/rigid/irreducible, with a
  reducible slice tangent 10 — correcting an earlier numerical "tangent 14"), a measure-zero **slice at n=4** (`L=−M⁴`,
  exact over ℚ(ω): A-free tangent 29/kernel 19), and **not realized on any irreducible representation at n=5**. A validated
  reusable toolkit (`sln_toolkit.py`) seals the recurring bug classes (finite-difference, sqrt-branch, near-singular `t⁻¹`).
  **The self-scrutiny campaign (multi-agent workflow) found real bugs in merged results, verified and corrected them:**
  (i) **n=5 (V143):** the banked "non-ss: 0/120, no irreducible reps" was a `det t=0`-drift artifact — with `det t=1` pinned,
  irreducible SL(5) reps with spectrum {1,1,1,−1,−1} **do exist** (non-semisimple `[3]`-block Jordan types; two independent
  certificates, Burnside rank 25 **and** Schur commutant dim 1); degree=rank fails on them, so the headline survives, reason
  corrected. (ii) **B95/V79:** "the principal spectrum is *forced*" → forced *given* the mult-(n−2)/finite-order ansatz
  (counterexample {1,ω,ω²,e^{±iπ/3}}); and the **finite-order insight** — a principal/Dehn-filling rep has `A` finite-order
  ⟹ semisimple ⟹ `A²=I` ⟹ dihedral ⟹ reducible, so **no irreducible principal rep at n=5 is PROVEN** (upgrading the n=5
  endpoint from numerical to proven, reconciling B95 ↔ B153). (iii) **P10** (owner-approved CLAIMS.md down-tiering):
  "five independent filters all select 4₁" → trace-3 sieve **PROVED**; the other four documented/suggestive
  (NEEDS-SPECIALIST). (iv) **B92/V76-V78:** "all det=−1 trace-`m` matrices conjugate to the companion" is **false at m≥4**
  (form class number `h(m²+4)=2` at m=4, disc 20); the companion is one GL(2,ℤ) class among `h`. (v) **V99/B112:** the
  "sign half for all n" headline (already self-relabeled by B116/B117/B118) given a ledger back-pointer. The audit's B95 flag
  and the independent n=5 re-derivation *converged* on the same gap. MATH tier; **two-mirrors** (the audit de-risks, novelty
  still NEEDS-SPECIALIST); nothing promoted to `CLAIMS.md` (P10 was reworded *down*); P1–P9, P11–P16, B85 untouched.

  and fourth independent direction — chirality and arithmetic). **Surviving MATH:** the golden substitution's
  **fusion algebra** is the Fibonacci/Yang–Lee fusion algebra (`λ²−λ−1`, Perron `φ`; the categorification is *not* a
  framework output); the metallic family is the **achiral (Chern–Simons ≡ 0) + imaginary-quadratic corner** of the
  once-punctured-torus bundles (CS=0 to machine precision m=1..6 vs a discriminating census mix); **expansion ⊥
  unitary topological order** (hyperbolic→non-unitary, CS=0→`c₋=0`); and the **arithmetic trichotomy** — fusion

  **The proper name (`knowledge/K010`, `philosophy/P008`):** the object is the **metallic-mean Schrödinger cocycle**

  (commuting/periodic/AC spectrum) vs `κ>2` (irreducible/hyperbolic Damanik–Gorodetski horseshoe/Cantor spectrum) —

  determines the *field* of the perturbative quantum series — a *theorem*, proven for our exact family
  (once-punctured-torus bundles, Yoon arXiv:2110.11003; Dimofte–Garoufalidis 1202.6268). **Floor 2** (Mostow → `T[M]`
  rigidity): no marginal couplings; `M` selects the SUSY phase (`4₁` → unbroken SUSY, gapped vacua, Cho–Gang–Kim
  2007.01532); `H₁` torsion → one-form/center symmetry. **The wall:** 3d→4d is data of the 2d *boundary* surface, not
  the 3-manifold; the SUSY-breaking *scale* is orthogonal input. Honest ceiling **N=4 SYM / N=2\*** (geometric
  Langlands) — not the Standard Model. So we lack no concept; we lack what no 3-manifold can carry. Two in-house
  facts: **(A)** `H₁(M_m) = ℤ ⊕ (ℤ/m)²` (Smith normal form of `M_m²−I = m·M_m`; SnapPy `m=1..7`) — the metallic `m`
  *is* the order of the homology torsion; **(B)** arithmetic(`m=1,2`) ⟺ `κ` rational in z on the geometric component
  (κ-degree over `ℚ(z)` = `[1,1,3,3,7,6]`) — **family-specific, not a law** (no "arithmetic ⟺ simple A-poly"
  theorem). Firewalled readings: `speculations/S029` (the `H₁`-torsion → center-symmetry / `m→ℤ/m→`SU(m)→SM reading,
  POSTULATED, with **five** explicit kill conditions — incl. that `T[M]` is rank-1 *abelian* so `ℤ/m` is a
  line-spectrum symmetry, not an `SU(m)` gauge group), `philosophy/P007` (the object as a **maximal probe** of the
  geometry↔QFT correspondence, not a seed of reality), `speculations/LADDER_LITERATURE.md` (the citation map), the
  `PHYSICS_BRIDGE_MAP` ladder section. Also **corrects** the inherited "exactly two arithmetic punctured-torus
  bundles" off-by-one (Bowditch–Maclachlan–Reid 1995 = *three* commensurability classes; "m=1,2 arithmetic" is a
  family-restricted statement) across K009/K002/B125. MATH/number-theory tier; physics POSTULATED/quarantined; nothing
  to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 and the functorial `Sym(W)→trace-ring` wall untouched.

### Changed
- **B125 — arithmeticity correction (overturns K009; 2026-06-08; V114, TESTED-POSITIVE).** With SnapPy now runnable
  in-sandbox, the invariant trace field `kM` of the metallic family is computable directly. Result: **arithmeticity
  does *not* uniquely select `m=1`** — it selects **{m=1 golden `ℚ(√−3)`, m=2 silver `ℚ(i)`}** and kills `m≥3`. The
  orientable metallic members are the once-punctured-torus **bundles** `M_m² = R^m L^m` (`m=1` = the figure-eight,
  `m004`); the two arithmetic ones are in different Bianchi families (not commensurable) — the "exactly two arithmetic
  punctured-torus bundles" K009 already cited. This **corrects** the B123/K009 "third *independent* / *unique* `m=1`
  arithmetic" sub-claim, which mis-applied **Reid 1991** (a *knot* theorem) to bundles. **Corrected:**
  `knowledge/K009` (arithmeticity is a two-element selector; systole + expansion still uniquely select `m=1`),
  `K002`, `K004`, `knowledge/INDEX`, and the V112 ledger row (annotated). **Preserved:** Reid 1991 stands
  (knots ≠ bundles; `m=2` being arithmetic confirms its scope); the order-6 echo stays an observation. **Honest:** the
  two arithmetic verdicts + the `m≥3` non-arithmetic verdict reproduce robustly two ways (shape field +
  traces-of-squares); the exact `m≥3` field degree is precision-sensitive and not over-claimed. Tooling availability
  recorded in `REPRODUCIBILITY` (SnapPy 3.3.2 + cypari installable in-sandbox — gate lifted; MAGMA still
  unavailable). MATH tier only; physics POSTULATED/quarantined untouched; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 and the
  functorial `Sym(W)→trace-ring` wall untouched.
- **Documentation refresh to B124/V113 (2026-06-08; docs only, no math, no claims).** Brought the whole governed
  documentation layer up to the current state of the research, which had run well ahead of it. **`knowledge/`
  completed:** wrote all seven stubbed explainers — `K001` (trace map & character variety), `K002` (the metallic
  family & continued fractions), `K003` (the Dickson tower), `K004` (figure-eight / Dehn filling / A-polynomials),
  `K005` (the opposition involution `θ=−w₀`), `K006` (the 3d-3d correspondence + its firewall), `K007` (the
  Fibonacci/quasicrystal trace map); the layer is now `K001–K009`, all written (standard material cited to the
  literature, project use cited to `B`/`V`, no new claims). **`story/`:** added chapter `09 — the representation,
  crystallized` (the B111–B124 arc: the sign half proved, `ρ_n = Sym^n(W)`, the external monodromy fundamental, the
  functorial wall) and refreshed `08`. **`docs/atlas/`:** added the representation-program sections to
  `SUCCESS_ATLAS`, `RESEARCH_TREE`, and `GLOSSARY`, and a "Pattern G" block of B111–B124 kills to `FAILURE_ATLAS`.
  **`ROADMAP`:** refreshed the Phase B probe ladder through B33–B124 and the suite count (369 passed). **Stale live
  ranges fixed:** `S001…S021 → S001…S028`, `K001–K007 → K001–K009 (all written)`, `P000–P003/P005 → P000–P006`
  across `ARCHITECTURE`, `README`, `philosophy/PHILOSOPHICAL_PATHS`, `speculations/GOVERNANCE`, `knowledge/INDEX`
  and `knowledge/GOVERNANCE`. Nothing promoted to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched; the firewall and the functorial
  `Sym(W)→trace-ring` prize are unchanged.

### Added
- **B124 — reciprocal `(λ,1/λ)` pairs + the time-reversal involution `λ↔1/λ` (2026-06-08; V113).** Two
  **strictly-separated** tiers. *Generic (symplectic):* the trace map is a reversible area-preserving map, so the
  Jacobian spectrum at a hyperbolic fixed point is **reciprocal-closed** `(λ,1/λ)` and time-reversal (the inverse
  map) acts as `λ↔1/λ`, swapping stable/unstable — symplectic geometry, **not** a metallic feature; the only
  metallic-specific datum is the **rate** `log φ²` (same lesson as unitarity / tautological roots / the volume
  conjecture). Anchor: the SL(2) **void** Jacobian `{φ²,−1,φ⁻²}`, `det=−1`. *Metallic-specific (the supplement):* at
  SL(n≥3) `det=−1` the tower carries **negative** reciprocal-pair modes (`char(−M^h)` sectors; `det=+1` has **none**)
  — a `det=−1` **sign/chirality** imbalance `O(n/2)` (= amphichirality B118/B121, via the inversion identity
  `char(M⁻¹)=char(−M)`). **Decisive recompute: expanding count == contracting count EXACTLY, every n, both det → NO
  arrow** — the asymmetry is **chirality (P)**, not time-direction (T). The exact constant is **open** (the raw `±1`
  excess is period-4, not `⌊n/2⌋`; n≥5 inflated by the B117 middle-band doubling — do **not** bank the closed form).
  Math banked in `knowledge/K008`; the **"two-headed time"** *reading* (Carroll–Chen / CPT-symmetric resonance) is a
  **labeled overlay**, firewalled in `philosophy/P006` and the dynamics fork `speculations/S002` (corrected to **no
  arrow** + one DORMANT metallic-specific thread: does the seed select the reference point?). Tier discipline: the
  math and the interpretation never share a sentence. Physics quarantined; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched;
  the functorial `Sym(W)→trace-ring` wall is untouched.
- **B123 — m=1 arithmeticity, the third independent `m=1` selection criterion (2026-06-08; V112, `SUPPORTED`).**
  The figure-eight complement's regular ideal-triangulation shape is the 6th cyclotomic root `z₀ = e^{iπ/3}`
  (`z²−z+1 = Φ₆`), invariant trace field `ℚ(√−3)` → **arithmetic**; by **Reid (1991)** the figure-eight is the
  *unique* arithmetic knot complement, so the `m≥2` metallic manifolds are not arithmetic. This joins the **systole**
  (B92/S001) and the **expansion threshold** (P004/B120) as a third *independent* import that picks `m=1` — written
  up as `knowledge/K009`. **Computed in-house:** the Φ₆ shape and the **order-6 echo** (the `(0,0,0)` non-void
  Jacobian spectrum `λ³+1` at `κ=−2`, the geometric cusp — banked as an *observation, not a connection*). **Cited /
  gated:** Reid 1991; the `m≥2` trace-field non-arithmeticity is the **named confirmation step** (SnapPy/Magma — no
  in-house classifier), so `SUPPORTED` not `TESTED-POSITIVE`. Triage companions, same PR: **five quantum/knot
  observations tombstoned** as standard theory in our notation (unitarity `|λ|=1` / roots-of-unity tautology /
  Kashaev=volume conjecture / `z₀`-k=4 coincidence / "three regimes") in `speculations/TOMBSTONES.md`; one **DORMANT
  tooling-gated target** sharpened (`speculations/S027` §3, the metallic phase-structure discriminator). The `det=−1`
  middle-eigenvalue `=−1` is the proved **B121** parity (asset, cross-ref). Physics quarantined; nothing to
  `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.

### Changed
- **B122 interlude extensions — the det layers split + the Sym tower is void-specific (2026-06-07; annotations, no
  new ledger row).** Two terrain-sweeping findings banked as extensions of B122 (verify-don't-trust): **(F1)** the
  **magnitude layer** (the W-identity / `μ_d`) is **`det`-independent** — a polynomial identity in `(x,y)`, holds
  `det=+1` as well as `det=−1` (verified through n=14), so it is *more general than the metallic ray*; the **sign
  layer** (the inversion identity `char(M⁻¹)=char(−M)`, the parity factor) is **`det=−1`-specific** (the parity
  `(t−1)(t+1)→(t−1)²` collapses going golden → fig-8 `=`golden², `det=+1`). **(F2)** the `Sym` tower is
  **void-specific**: at SL(2) the void Jacobian `=Sym²(M)`, the other fixed point `(0,0,0)` is **6th roots of unity**
  (`λ³+1`, `DT⁶=I` — order 6, a corrected narration slip of "order 3"), elliptic not `Sym` (corroborates B106).
  Confirmations: the W-identity holds through n=14; the S023 box-dimensions do not cleanly separate (finite-size,
  reconfirming the W1 demotion). None touch the wall — the functorial `Sym(W)→trace-ring` construction is still the
  one missing piece. Nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16 untouched.
- **Firewalled triage of the cross-chat "seven hints" (2026-06-07; docs/governance, no math).** Banking the
  physics-facing hints on the `μ_d` object as **different tiers** so the firewall does not leak: `philosophy/P005`
  (laws vs states — INTERPRETATION on B120's spectral/geometric split); `speculations/S028` (the
  `Sym⁴(3-space)=sl(4)` reading — the **algebra is proved** in B122, the **"3+1" geometry is fenced** POSTULATED,
  "spacetime" stripped as adjacent to the DEAD S017/S018, bound to B122's open functorial hinge; the spin-2/gravity
  overlay recorded fenced *underneath* the math, never in `knowledge/`). The CS-crossover `k≈4↔n=4` is **tombstoned**
  (m-dependent volume coincidence). Watch-item fixes: **S023** re-scoped so `TESTED-POSITIVE` rests on the exact
  arithmetic field-distinctness (box-dimension demoted to supporting/finite-size); **S027** sharpened so the golden
  4₁ Kashaev is the *textbook* feasibility witness and the new content is the **m≥2** cocycle. **`S028 ≠ S024`** (a
  numbering collision in the incoming handoff, corrected). Nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; physics chapter CLOSED.
- **Intellectual-architecture reorganization (2026-06-07; docs/org only, no math).** Introduced four governed rooms
  for the evolving speculative ideas, all firewalled (nothing promotes to `CLAIMS.md`; the physics chapter stays
  CLOSED; the mathematics never cites them): **`speculations/`** (the catalog `S001…S021` with a proof-status enum
  incl. `HELD(value-matching)`, the "final theory" exercise `PHYSICS_EXERCISE.md`, per-live-speculation files, the
  DEAD `TOMBSTONES.md`, and `archive/`); **`philosophy/`** (`GOVERNANCE` + `P000–P003` + the migrated `P1–P5`
  register + `METALLIC_FOUNDATIONS`); **`story/`** and **`knowledge/`** (per the priority order); and the one-page
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` (the one-way firewall arrow). **Migration:** `paths/philosophical/{PHILOSOPHICAL_PATHS,
  METALLIC_FOUNDATIONS}.md → philosophy/`; `paths/philosophical/{PHYSICS_RESONANCES, COSMOGONY_FROM_THE_VOID}.md →
  speculations/archive/` (COSMOGONY superseded by the corrected `PHYSICS_EXERCISE.md` — notably the κ=−2 cusp fix
  and the HELD tier). All **live** references redirected (frontier firewall banners, READMEs, REPO_STATE, atlas,
  this file, the repo-map); append-only `PROGRESS_LOG.md` history and historical ledger rows left intact, with a
  migration mapping recorded in `PROGRESS_LOG.md`.

### Added
- **B122 — the tower is symmetric powers of the external fundamental `W = V⊕1` (2026-06-07, Ledger V111; no
  physics).** Banks Chat-2's W-identity (audited, verify-don't-trust) and **unifies it with B121** (one object, not
  two). The two-sequence re-expressed as a virtual `GL(2)`-module: `ρ_n = Sym^n(W) ⊕ (Sym^{n−3}(W) ⊖ W)`, `W=V⊕1`.
  A **genuine `GL(2)`-module iso** (symbolic in general `(x,y)`, det-independent, n≤8; module-level proved n=3,4 via
  B103) — *not* vacuous (the tower is a `GL(2,ℤ)`-rep). **`W` is B121's external monodromy fundamental:** `det(W)=−1`
  (external) vs `det(Fricke=Sym²V)=+1` (internal/Kostant), so Chat-2's "`W`=Fricke" kill **is** B121's
  external≠internal; the tower's odd weights = `Sym^n(V⊕1)∋V` = the B121 parity obstruction. `Sym⁴(3-space)=15=sl(4)`
  is the unique saturating order (the n=4 fixed point, B117). **Honest:** a repackaging + a canonical `W`, **not** a
  wall-bypass (no functorial `Sym(W)→trace-ring` map; the `Sym⁴(3)=15` saturation is n=4-only). Re-aims the prize
  ("prove the tower is *functorially* `Sym^n(W)⊕…`") without lowering the wall; magnitude layer only (signs = the
  det=−1 layer, B118). K008 extended. The 3+1/spin-2 readings are firewalled (S028). Nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; P1–P16
  untouched.
- **Physics-bridge sweep, Phase 3 — the heavy forks mapped + the Kashaev feasibility (2026-06-07, Ledger V110;
  FIREWALLED).** The three heavy/deferred bridges are mapped as `DORMANT` speculations with concrete computations +
  obstructions: **S025** (off-principal independent spectral content at higher rank — EMPTY at 4₁/SL(3), B110; open
  only at SL(4)/SL(5) or other manifolds; obstruction = no SL(4) char-variety classification + non-Hermitian
  realization), **S026** (does the SL(n) tower organize the `T[4₁]` state-integral at fixed knot / varying rank? —
  moduli/A-variety level in-house, the quantum state-integral is research-level), **S027** (the metallic Kashaev
  invariants as quantum modular forms — **feasibility shown in-house**, `kashaev_feasibility.py`: `J_N(4₁)→vol(4₁)`
  monotone; the open part is the Zagier–Garoufalidis cocycle + the per-knot arithmetic in `ℚ(√(m²+4))`). All target
  structural/arithmetic content, **not** new fundamental physics; the continuous family-in-m is dead, so the forks
  vary the rank `n`, not the seed `m`. Firewalled; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; physics chapter stays CLOSED; P1–P16
  untouched. **This completes the physics-bridge sweep** (Phases 0–3): the terrain is fully mapped (dead/live/heavy),
  the two live leads are banked (S023 distinct real quasicrystals, B121 the monodromy/Hitchin grading), and the
  heavy forks are scoped with feasibility + obstructions.
- **Physics-bridge sweep, Phase 2 — the monodromy sl(2) grading (2026-06-07, Ledger V109; no physics in the math).**
  B121 gives the **positive** characterization of the banked negative "tower ≠ Kostant" (B89-T/B98): the `(n²−1)`-dim
  tower carries two `SL(2)`-actions on the adjoint — the **internal principal** `sl(2)⊂sl_n` (Kostant `⊕Sym^{2i}`,
  even weights, `det=+1` = the Hitchin/Fuchsian section, B101) and the **external monodromy** `GL(2,ℤ)` (the tower
  `⊕Sym^d(M_m)^{μ_d}`, mixed parity, `det=−1` = the mapping class group). They agree only at n=2; for n≥3 the tower
  has **odd** highest weights (Kostant is even-only) ⇒ inequivalent, and the obstruction **is** `det(M_m)=−1`
  (`det Sym^d(M_m)=(−1)^{d(d+1)/2}`; the odd blocks are the `char(−M^h)` sectors, B112/B118 — the program's own
  catalog parity, B93/B94). **Not** a dimension coincidence. The monodromy is the Hitchin section's `det=−1`
  monodromy partner; the Hitchin/Langlands/class-S *reading* is firewalled (`speculations/S024`, ceiling N=4 SYM).
  No physics in the math; nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; physics chapter stays CLOSED; P1–P16 untouched.
- **Physics-bridge sweep, Phase 1 — the metallic means are distinct real quasicrystals (2026-06-07, Ledger V108;
  FIREWALLED, no physics promotion).** A brave-but-honest sweep of the bridges to physics. First the **terrain map**
  (`speculations/PHYSICS_BRIDGE_MAP.md`): every bridge classified DEAD (masses/Λ/spacetime/holography/anyons/
  SW-family/SL(n≥3)-Hermitian-chain/tower=Kostant — do not revive), LIVE, or HEAVY. Then the Phase-1 live result
  (`frontier/physics_probes/metallic_spectra.py`, S023, `TESTED-POSITIVE`): the SL(2) Hermitian metallic
  quasicrystals (golden m=1, silver m=2, bronze m=3) are **arithmetically distinct real materials** — the
  gap-labeling module lives in `ℚ(√(m²+4))` = `ℚ(√5),ℚ(√2),ℚ(√13)` (three distinct fields), with distinct RG scale
  `φ_m` and spectral dimension — **even though** the tower *algebra* (the Sym two-sequence `μ_d`) is m-universal
  (B120). The algebra is one object; the physics is a family of distinct, buildable materials. **Honest scope:** 1D
  condensed matter, **not** fundamental physics; the SL(n≥3) extension is blocked (non-Hermitian). Firewalled;
  nothing to `CLAIMS.md`; the physics chapter stays CLOSED; P1–P16 untouched.
- **B120 — the trivial-point tower is determined by `(n; trace, det)` (2026-06-07, Ledger V107; no physics).**
  Banks the Chat-2 exploration interlude (Q2/Q3) + the computed Supplement (S1–S5), verify-don't-trust. The
  `(n²−1)`-dim tower (the Sym two-sequence, B117/B103) is **one object** fixed by two inputs — the unfolding depth
  `n` and the abelianization seed `(trace, det)`. **Q3:** distinct same-`(trace,det)` integer matrices give
  identical towers. **S2 (the deep lead):** the Sym content `μ_d` is m-independent — the `μ_d` are plethysm
  multiplicities of the `GL(2,ℤ)`-rep `ρ_n`, trace-blind; this **reframes the prize as a plethysm** but is a
  *reduction, not a closure* (proved n=3,4; same trace-ring wall). **Q2:** degree=rank **splits** — (I) spectral
  `char(Mⁿ)` factor ⟺ `μ_n=1`, all n / (II) geometric longitude=meridianⁿ, n∈{3,4} (order `{4,3,2,∞}`) — dissolving
  the apparent B117-vs-B119 tension. **Three corrections** (verify-don't-trust): S1's `(n²−3n)/2` → `(n−4)(n+1)/2`
  (the doubling band forced); S5's `2·max(1,n−h−1)` guess refuted **and** a closed form found (heights run 0..n:
  `count(n,0)=n−1`; `2(n−2)` h∈{1,2}; `2(n−h)` 3≤h≤n−1; `2` h=n); S4 confirms B116 is factor-level (the Chat-2
  "n=3 divergence" was a units error). **Governed-folder banking:** `knowledge/K008` (the determination explainer),
  `philosophy/P004` (expansion is interaction-born — `M_m=(twist)ᵐ·(swap)`, the SL(2,ℤ) finite-order-generation
  spine), and the **downgrade** of the Markov-blanket / boundary-open reading to low-rank n∈{3,4} (TWO_SYMMETRY_FRAME,
  S022). The all-`n` prize is unchanged and un-fused: prove the Sym two-sequence `μ_d` (B103), now seen as a plethysm.
- **B118/B119 — the sign-half gate closed + the power-half sharp negative (2026-06-07, Ledger V105–V106; no
  physics).** Chat-2's Path 1 (the gate) and Path 3 (the hard path). **B118 (V105):** B112 proved the `(+1,−1)`
  eigenspace *dimensions* of `θ=−w₀` on the height-`h` roots by a permutation argument; the `⌈`-vs-`⌊` tip is
  decided by the sign θ carries on the lone fixed root (odd `m=n−h`). Path 1 asked whether that sign is `+1` for
  all `(n,h)` (which would make B64 a uniform "`+1` sector = `char(M^h)`" theorem). Realizing θ as the genuine
  *signed* contragredient involution `τ(X)=−J Xᵀ J⁻¹`, the **fixed-root sign `= (−1)^{h+1}`** (symbolic + verified
  `n≤12`) — `+1` for odd `h`, `−1` for even `h`: **NOT a uniform +1.** So B64's "`+1` sector = `char(M^h)`" holds
  only for odd `h` — a **refinement/correction** of B112's unsigned "fixed root is always +1". The `(⌈,⌊)`
  dimensions stand; B112's `char(M^h)=⌈` labeling stays tower-verified `n≤5` (B118 supplies the all-`n` sign).
  Emergent (non-circular): the fixed-root sign `= +1` ⟺ the inversion identity `char(M^{−h})=char(−M^h)` ⟺ `h`
  odd. The θ-split is **not the tower** (the Sym two-sequence, B117; diverges `n≥6`).
  **B119 (V106) — a sharp negative:** `Mᵏ` central on the principal iff `order(a)|k` (`a+1/a=3−n`,
  `order(a)={4,3,2,∞}`); `k=n` is non-central where the principal exists (n=3,4) but **not unique** ⇒ centrality
  does **not** force `k=n` (the proved A-poly B83 pins it), and for **n≥5 the principal does not exist
  irreducibly** (B95) ⇒ `exponent=rank` is an `n∈{3,4}` phenomenon; the brave `k=n` proof cannot be completed. The
  secondary 2n-type gives exponent `n−1` (extends B111). Emergent (B111 ADD2 correction): the cusp order is
  `{4,3,2,∞}`, not a clean `{n−1,n+1,2n}` law (B111 ADD2 conflated three components). The all-`n` tower stays the
  prize = prove the Sym two-sequence `μ_d` (B103).
- **B117 — the interleaving insight: the tower is the Sym two-sequence; the "promotion" is a `Sym¹` absence
  (2026-06-07, Ledger V104; no physics).** The **headline reframing** of the B111–B116 run (the Opus interleaving
  insight, verify-don't-trust). The `(n²−1)`-dim trivial-point tower is **one object** — the **Sym two-sequence**
  (B103/B58) — not two separable halves (sign + power). A **dimension identity**
  `(n+1)(n+2)/2 − (n²−1) = −(n−4)(n+1)/2` (roots `{−1,4}`) **derives** B103's `μ_d = [2≤d≤n]+[0≤d≤n−3]` (n=4 the
  unique perfect fit; n=3 omits `Sym¹`, the unique subset `{0,2,3}`; n≥5 doubles `Sym²..Sym^{n−3}`). So **the
  "promotion" is a `Sym¹` absence** — the B111/B113 "two-halves"/"promotion" framing is **superseded and
  tombstoned** (the height-1 `char(−M)` at n=3 is `Sym³`'s contribution, not a "promoted `Sym¹`"). **degree=rank's
  `char(Mⁿ)` = `Sym^n` presence** (`μ_n=1` ∀n; dim-forced only at n=3 — *not* "by dimension"; rep-theory n=2,4;
  two-sequence form n≥5). `Sym⁰..⁴` product = the B80 proved n=4 tower. **B112 relabeled to three tiers** (the
  `−w₀` multiplicity structure up to the fixed-root label — proved all n; the labeling = B64, pending B118; the
  tower realization with powers — verified n≤5, superseded). **Re-aimed prize:** prove the **Sym two-sequence
  `μ_d`** for all n (B103's open problem).
- **B116 reconciliation + a CORRECTION to B112 (2026-06-07, Ledger V103; no physics).** The B112↔B103
  reconciliation (run to join the prize's two halves) found a **verify-don't-trust correction** instead: the
  **Sym two-sequence (B103) = the actual tower** (it matches the resolved SL(5) and carries `char(Mⁿ)`
  automatically), while the **θ-split (B112) = the tower only `n ≤ 5`** and **diverges at `n=6`** (the banked
  V26/V27). **B112's "sign half proved for all n" is explicitly downgraded to "n ≤ 5"** (the combinatorial lemma
  stands for all n; the *tower-identification* — the V25 gap — holds only n≤5). The all-`n` sign half is **OPEN**;
  the live route is the **Sym two-sequence** proof (B103), the better tower-candidate.
- **The ρ_n sign half PROVED + the five follow-on paths — B112–B115 (2026-06-07, Ledger V99–V102; no physics).**
  **B112 (V99) — the headline:** the **sign half of `ρ_n` is proved for all n**, engine-free — an elementary
  root-system reversal lemma (`θ=−w₀` acts as the reversal on the height-`h` roots of `A_{n−1}`, `(+1,−1)`
  eigenspace dims `(⌈(n−h)/2⌉, ⌊(n−h)/2⌋)`, verified all n≤12) × the banked B64 parity assignment ⇒
  `mult char(M^h)=⌈(n−h)/2⌉`, `char(−M^h)=⌊(n−h)/2⌋`. The first catalog piece proved from first principles for all
  n. **B113 (V100):** the proved closed form **resolves the SL(5) sign sectors** at heights 2–4 by proof
  (including `char(M²)²·char(−M²)` = B62's two gauge-corrupted modes the eps-series could not resolve), and
  **localizes degree=rank to height-1 + `char(Mⁿ)`** (the promotion is n-dependent — the power half stays open).
  **B114 (V101):** the covering-degree mechanism is **TESTED-NEGATIVE** (full covering degree `~k^{n−1}`, not `k`).
  **B115 (V102):** the known SL(4) Dehn-filling reps are forced-locus (like SL(3)); off-locus SL(4) + genus-2
  degree=rank scoped **OPEN** with named obstructions. **State of the prize:** the sign half is proved (all n);
  the open piece is the **power half** (the single degree=rank promotion `char(M)→char(Mⁿ)`, localized to the
  height-1/top-power interface).
- **B111 — the tower's sign structure + the degree=rank exponent (2026-06-07, Ledger V98; no physics).** The
  "sign findings" handoff. The opposition-involution all-heights **closed form** (`⌈(n−h)/2⌉` / `⌊(n−h)/2⌋`,
  matching B62 height-2) is **not** the proved tower: `Tower(n) = [closed form, heights 1..n−1]` with **exactly one
  `char(M¹)` promoted to `char(Mⁿ)`** (verified n=3,4) — the single non-bulk piece being `char(Mⁿ)` = the
  **degree=rank** top power. So the tower's **sign half is closed-form** (bulk θ); the only open piece is the
  degree=rank promotion (peripheral). **ADDITION 1 (proved):** on the SL(4) secondary `M⁴=−1` is scalar ⇒ `k=4`
  algebraically impossible (`k=3` forced); on the principal `M⁴` non-scalar ⇒ `k=4` allowed (`k=n` not proven).
  **ADDITION 2:** cusp orders `{n−1,n+1,2n}`; the `ord−1` formula TESTED-NEGATIVE. SL(3) parity corrected to
  `(t−1)(t−det N)`. Opens two leads (`speculations/S022` peripheral ℤ/4 + `TWO_SYMMETRY_FRAME`); `s_n↔c` DEAD.
- **The Final Computation Arc — B108/B109/B110 (2026-06-07, Ledger V95–V97; no physics).** **B108 (V95):** the
  top-priority `θ=−w₀ → c` derivation — the mandatory **hinge fails**; `θ` is an involution (order 2) and predicts
  the order-`≤2` Dehn-filling scalars `c∈{1,−1}` but **not** the order-4 secondary `c=i`, so degree=rank's `c`
  stays **OPEN** (missing a `ℤ/4` ingredient; cusp-spectrum candidate, B95). `θ` *is* confirmed a tower symmetry
  (`[P,J(m)]=0`). **B109 (V96):** the trace-map dynamics at the void (D2) — verify-don't-trust corrected the
  handoff's coordinate-axis facts to the rigorous linearization (`DT₁²` eigenvalues `{1,φ⁴,φ⁻⁴}`; the void's
  center manifold = the tower's root-of-unity parity sector, dim 1@SL2/2@SL3; a (2,1) `κ` saddle) + L5 literature
  (degree=rank `Mⁿ=L` apparently new; the `W₄` anchor real but generic). **B110 (V97):** the off-locus irreducible
  sector of `4₁` at SL(3) is **EMPTY** (HMP's three components all on the forced locus); the higher-rank fork stays
  open. Plus the **dead-ends register** (`docs/atlas/FAILURE_ATLAS.md`: ~30 kills by pattern, REVIVABLE lens) and
  probe updates **S001** (all-`m` amphichiral PROVED), **S006** (Bell → TESTED-NEGATIVE).
- **B107 physics-connection audit — banked as a NEGATIVE (2026-06-07, Ledger V94; POSTULATED/FIREWALLED).**
  Banks the CC-web physics exploration as a first-class **dead-end log**; *all* physical readings are
  **POSTULATED and firewalled** to `speculations/archive/PHYSICS_RESONANCES.md` (Path 8), **nothing to
  `CLAIMS.md`**, the physics chapter stays **CLOSED**, P1–P16 untouched. **A (anchor, verified):** the SL(2)
  metallic trace map `φ_m: a→aᵐb, b→a` **is** the Kohmoto–Kadanoff–Tang / Fibonacci-Hamiltonian trace map —
  `tr[A,B]=x²+y²+z²−xyz−2` (Sütő/Fricke–Vogt) conserved ∀m (symbolic m=1..4), `φ_1=(z,x,xz−y)`. **B (the
  headline negative, verified):** every SL(3) `m=1` tower eigenvalue is `±φᵏ` — **one geometric scale `log φ`**;
  a mass spectrum is a Hessian, not one ratio, so the tower is **re-presented moduli-space monodromy, not new
  physics**. **C:** the tower/torsion `=` masses/dimensions identifications are **withdrawn category errors**
  (only the moduli-space `M_SUSY ≅ M_flat` + three-branch ↔ three-fixed-point map is citable). **D:** citations
  confirmed (GKLP 1305.0937; DGG 1108.4389, 1112.5179). **E:** the one open fork = the off-principal
  multichannel reps. Reproduced (`quasicrystal_anchor`, `tower_roots_are_golden`); locking test; FINDINGS A–E.
- **B106 Dehn-filling anatomy + hygiene (2026-06-07, Ledger V92/V93; no physics).** The trace map at the
  never-computed **third** fixed-point class (Dehn-filling reps, after trivial=tower and geometric=torsion).
  **D1:** three classes, three distinct Jacobian signatures — Dehn-filling **partially elliptic** (SL(3)
  `(1,1,6)`, SL(4) `(4,4,7)`, root-of-unity neutral eigenvalues); honest negative — the stability *type* does
  not encode the degree=rank exponent. **D4:** `Lᵢ=c·Mᵢ^k` per eigenvector (`c` a root of unity). **D3:** `M⁴=L`
  / `M³=L`, conjugates absent. **[V93 hygiene]** the D1 root-of-unity values pass the **B84 gauge-noise gate**
  (seed-stable); the D4 **principal** (`c=−1`) **corroborates** the proved B89/B83 (not new), the new content
  being the **secondary** (`c=i`, numerical), **SL(3) W2**, and the **per-eigenvector method**.
- **B105 three-obstacle correction + sharpened ρ_n target (2026-06-07, Ledger V91; no physics).** A further
  explicit downgrade of B105's "one collision is the common root cause": **n=5 is a structural threshold
  where three *distinct* `A_{n−1}` obstacles degenerate** — degree=rank (B95, eigenvalue `−1`, `A²=I`), the
  tower/eps-series doubling (B62, golden `char(M²)²` from the A₄ height-2 `θ=−w₀` (4,2) split), and trace-ring
  non-closure (engine-free, onset n=4) — different eigenvalues (`−1` vs `φ²`), independent derivations,
  different onset. The open `ρ_n` target is **sharpened**: prove `char(ρ_n)=catalog` by reproducing the
  opposition-involution multiplicities directly from `ρ_n`, the contested n=5 piece being *only* B62's
  `char(M²)²` (the degree=rank `−1` and trace-ring non-closure are separate, untouched problems). The n=4
  scope claim is hedged. Verified (`three_obstacle_distinction()`); banked in B105 (`CORRECTIONS_V91`).
- **The n=5 wall + the ρ_n convergence, with the V90 audit (2026-06-07, Ledger V89 + V90; suite 278+ pass, 1
  skip; no physics).** `frontier/B105_n5_wall_and_convergence/`: the "n=5 Resolution" handoff, then **two
  explicit inference downgrades (V90)**. **N5:** the SL(5) eps-series resolves **21/24** Dickson factors, the
  resolved 21 are **universally catalog-consistent** (across seeds and monodromies); the 3 unresolved are
  supported as `Sym²` by **structural routes** (B62/B89-T/B103). **[V90 Correction A]** the seed-variation of
  the 3 unresolved factors is the eps-series rank-deficiency signature (B84), **uninformative** about the
  truth — so the explicit **n=5 catalog is OPEN** and a structural deviation there is neither ruled in nor
  out (the earlier "coordinate artifact, not structural / formula-doesn't-change" inference is **withdrawn**).
  **[V90 Correction B]** there is **no proved "natural boundary at n=4"** — `char(J(n))=catalog` is a class
  function for **all `n`** (B103); n=4 is a *methodological ceiling*, not a theorem (the earlier "complete at
  n=4 with a proved boundary" is **withdrawn**); the cusp collision is a *candidate* root cause. **Convergence
  + open frontier:** the project converges on one object `ρ_n` (the `GL(2,ℤ)`-rep on the SL(n) trace ring),
  fully characterized n=3,4, **explicit n≥5 OPEN** — the live target being to prove `char(ρ_n)=catalog`
  directly from `ρ_n` + B62's multiplicities. Literature L1 (GKLP 1305.0937) + L4 (Bonahon–Dreyer 1209.3526 /
  Douglas–Sun 2011.01768) cited; H1–H6 / C1–C4 tabulated; physics quarantined.
- **The Dehn-twist route: SL(4) universality + the SL(5) wall (2026-06-07, Ledger V88; suite 274 passed, 1
  skip; no physics).** `frontier/B104_dehn_twist_tower/`: executes the "Dehn-Twist Route" handoff in full —
  build any monodromy's trace map by composing the elementary twists `U,L,S` inside the eps-series (not the
  Procesi ring, the B85 wall). **SL(4) (proven):** the GATE reproduces B80's metallic tower; `J` factors
  through `N`; `char(J(N))` = the two-sequence catalog with **det-sign parity** for **metallic and
  non-metallic** `N` (e.g. `U²L=[[3,2],[1,1]]`, det +1) — the explicit SL(4) catalog is a computed theorem.
  **SL(5):** the engine inherits the eps-series gauge degeneracy (`char(J)≠catalog`, **21/24 Dickson factors
  resolve**, the doubly-degenerate sector, B61/B66) — a **computational** wall, not a rep-theory failure; the
  n≥5 obstruction is isolated to the eps-series degeneracy. Cite B103, B80, B61/B66, Lawton/Procesi.
- **The SL(n) tower as a GL(2,ℤ) representation (2026-06-07, Ledger V87; suite 269 passed, 1 skip; proven
  core P1–P16 untouched; no physics).** `frontier/B103_tower_equivariance/`: a **fourth route** to the
  metallic tower, synthesizing two CC-web handoffs. **Route 1 (universality, all n):** `J_φ(n)` factors
  through the abelianization `N ∈ GL(2,ℤ)` ⇒ `ρ_n` is a `GL(2,ℤ)`-rep ⇒ `char(J)` is a **class function =
  the catalog**, universal for metallic **and non-metallic** monodromies; **det-sign parity** sharpens B94
  (verified at SL(3) via the exact Lawton maps `U,L,S`). **Route 2 (n=3,4 exact over ℚ[m]):** an explicit
  `m`-independent invertible `P` with **`P·J(m)·P⁻¹ = ⊕_d Sym^d(M_m)^{μ_d}`** (intertwiner dim `=Σμ_d²`
  Schur), realizing the module-iso **(M)** constructively + exactly for n=3,4; sign sectors = `det=−1` twists.
  **Reframing:** the all-n tower = **decompose the `GL(2,ℤ)`-rep `ρ_n`**; universality structural (all n),
  explicit `μ_d` open n≥5 (the Procesi wall) — continuation B104. Cite B94, B85/B89-T, B80, Lawton, Procesi.
- **The W1/W2 dichotomy + the R4 boundary-controlled cubic continuation (2026-06-06, Ledger V86; suite 263
  passed, 1 skip; proven core P1–P16 untouched; no physics).** `frontier/B102_hitchin_continuation/`: two
  follow-ons to B101, verified before landing. **D1:** Cayley–Hamilton on `T₁²` forces every irreducible
  `Fix(T₁²)` SL(3) character into Case I (`trA=trA⁻¹`, self-dual) or the `trB=trB⁻¹=1` branch (0 "neither").
  **D2/D3:** realizing B71's components, **W1→`ρ(a)` elliptic `{1,i,−i}`, W2→`ρ(b)` elliptic** ⇒ **not
  Hitchin** (the genuine non-`Sym²` components are excluded by **ellipticity**, the cleaner obstruction; V0's
  geometric rep by complexity, `Q(√−3)`). **D4:** the `{1,i,−i}` spectrum = Task M's `n=3` spectrum (B95).
  **D5:** the boundary-controlled cubic family keeps the cusp real **only to first order** — generic
  second-order complexification; the handoff's `t*≈3.775` geodesic boundary does **not** reproduce
  (ray-dependent); the unipotent-preserving continuation is `open`. Cite Heusener–Muñoz–Porti, Labourie,
  Hitchin/Fock–Goncharov/Goldman/Marquis.
- **The Hitchin-component reframing (2026-06-06, Ledger V85; suite 256 passed, 1 skip; proven core P1–P16
  untouched; physics chapter stays CLOSED; physics chain firewalled).** `frontier/B101_hitchin_reframing/`:
  the geometric component V0 (B71, `Sym²` of the Fuchsian `SL(2,ℝ)` rep) **is the Fuchsian locus of the
  `SL(3,ℝ)` Hitchin / Fock–Goncharov positive component** of the once-punctured torus. **R1** (`STRUCTURAL`):
  the Anosov hallmark + the unique `SO(2,1)` form, signature `(2,1)`. **R2** (`dead`): the symmetric-space
  ladder — the principal `SL(2)` lands in split real forms; Lorentzian only at `k=2`, does not climb ⇒ **no
  tower of spacetimes** (kills the "3+1D at SL(3)" idea structurally). **R3**: `sl(3)=V₂⊕V₄`; `V0={cubic=0}`.
  **R4** (genuinely-new): `H¹(F₂,sl(3)_Ad)=8` splits `3⊕5` (Teichmüller ⊕ cubic) + an explicit Anosov
  deformation leaving V0 and breaking the `SO(2,1)` form. The Hitchin→Higgs→geometric-Langlands→N=4 SYM
  chain (Kapustin–Witten) is **cited context only** (`PHYSICS_RESONANCES.md` Path 7) with the ceiling stated
  (N=4 SYM, *not* the Standard Model / gravity / the universe); three dead-thread heuristics recorded in
  `docs/atlas/FAILURE_ATLAS.md`.
- **Geometry-invariants + literature-bridge pass (2026-06-06, Ledger V80–V84; suite 249 passed, 1 skip;
  proven core P1–P16 untouched; physics chapter stays CLOSED; physics interpretation quarantined).**
  "Compute the numbers, quarantine the interpretation" — bounded quantum-topology invariants on the
  metallic mapping-torus manifolds, banked as mathematics; every physics reading lives only in
  `speculations/archive/PHYSICS_RESONANCES.md` (`SPECULATION`, never promoted).
  `frontier/B96_geometry_invariants/` (V80): metallic volumes strictly monotone (`2.030<3.664<4.814`,
  `m=1`=systole); the volume Hessian is **definite `(0,2)`, NOT Lorentzian** (155/156 fillings of `4_1`
  below `V₀`) — the most-leveraged physics path returns negative.
  `frontier/B97_sl2r_lorentzian/` (V81): the `(2,1)` Lorentzian form is **located** as the
  `so(2,1)=sl(2,ℝ)` gauge algebra on the SL(2,ℝ)/Teichmüller component (toy 2+1 gravity) — structural, not
  emergent; the 3+1 wall untouched.
  `frontier/B98_geometric_jacobian/` (Probe 1, V82): at the **geometric** rep (not the trivial fixed line),
  `char(D T₁²)=(t−1)(t²−5t+1)` = the **adjoint torsion `τ₁=−3`** (twisted Alexander), **NOT** the Dickson
  tower — so the tower is a trivial-rep phenomenon (*consistent with* Daly arXiv:2411.04431 + 3d-3d, cited);
  tower ≠ Kostant branching.
  `frontier/B99_geometric_jacobian_sl3/` (Probe 1c, V83): the SL(3) geometric Jacobian is torsion-type
  (the `c=5` SL(2) torsion pair carried by `Sym²`), not the SL(3) tower.
  `frontier/B100_literature_crosscheck/` (Probes 2+6, V84): the Zickert/SnapPy **Ptolemy variety** of `4_1`
  (2 obstruction classes, 6 trivial-class reps) cross-validates B71 from an independent code path, and the
  **Baker–Petersen** (arXiv:1211.4479) twisted Alexander **is** the B98/B99 geometric Jacobian — two
  published frameworks agree (methods cited, not claimed).
- **Task M — the degree=rank mechanism (2026-06-06, Ledger V79; suite green; P1–P16 untouched).**
  `frontier/B95_degree_rank_mechanism/`: the V75 audit killed "exponent = Cayley–Hamilton degree"; B95
  finds what the exponent reads. The principal spectrum is **forced** by `tr A=tr A⁻¹=1` ({1,i,−i},
  {1,1,ω,ω²}, {1,1,1,−1,−1}, impossible n≥6); at n=5 it degenerates (`A²=I` → dihedral → reducible, no
  irreducible SL(5) principal rep — upgrades B78). So **"exponent = rank" is an n∈{3,4} phenomenon**; the
  mechanism reads the cusp's forced finite-order spectrum, explaining the n≥5 wall on both the tower and
  degree=rank. Corrects the handoff's SL(5) spectrum guess.
- **Paper 0 — the self-reference grounding (2026-06-06, Ledger V76–V78; suite 230 passed, 1 skip;
  proven core P1–P16 untouched; philosophy quarantined).** A foundational thread characterizing the
  metallic family by a condition (`m` free). `philosophy/METALLIC_FOUNDATIONS.md` (quarantined
  motivation, never a claim). `frontier/B92_metallic_classification/` (Layer 1, V76, `proven`): the family
  = the `det=−1`/period-1 slice up to `GL(2,ℤ)` conjugacy (entries ≤5), with MyCalc-2 (conjugacy census)
  and MyCalc-5 (systole/contingency). `frontier/B93_det_parity_bridge/` (Phase C, V77): MyCalc-1
  (`det=−1 ⟺` the tower's parity sectors) and MyCalc-4 (parity ≠ Galois — refines the handoff).
  `frontier/B94_tower_universality/` (G1, V78): **"universal catalog, det=−1 parity"** — the Dickson
  catalog survives any `GL(2,ℤ)` monodromy but the sign/parity sectors are `det=−1`-specific (so `det=−1`
  is structurally distinguished); degree=rank is det-agnostic (two problems).
- **Audit correction (2026-06-05, Ledger V75).** Corrected B90's framing: L1a is a tautology and
  "exponent = rank from Cayley–Hamilton" is refuted (the hinge test); only L1b is genuine. Strengthened
  B89-T with the J(m) cross-check against B80.
- **"Complete the Tower" run (2026-06-05, Ledger V70–V74; suite 220 passed, 1 skip; proven core
  P1–P16 untouched; `EXPERT_OUTREACH.md` dormant).** The CC-web handoff reconciled against `main` and
  the genuine open prizes executed:
  `frontier/B87_m3_genus/` (Task 3, V70) the m=3 spectral-curve genus — sequence `3,1,…`, m=2 a minimum
  (the `3,1,0` reading refuted), m=3 trace-relation curve genus 1;
  `frontier/B88_sl4_census/` (Task 2, V71) the SL(4) Dehn-filling census — **degrees {3,4}**, two
  components (`{1,1,ω,ω²}→M⁴=L`, `{prim 8th}→M³=L`);
  `frontier/B89_sl4_symbolic_M4L/` (Task 1a, V72) **`M⁴=L` PROVED symbolic-exact at SL(4)** over ℚ(ω)
  (upgrades V54 from ~1e-31), via the 10-equation exact ideal + the rank-drop-locus family;
  `frontier/B89T_tower_route/` (Task T, V73) the tower's **cohomological route closed** (a 3rd dead
  shortcut) + the explicit two-sequence **Sym-product** reduction (symbolic-in-m, proved n≤4) to one
  module-isomorphism;
  `frontier/B90_degree_rank_peripheral/` (Task 1b, V74) degree=rank's **uniform peripheral reduction** —
  Lemma 1 (`λ=μX⁻¹μY⁻¹`, `XμX⁻¹=μA`) proved uniformly; reduced to one collapse-lemma, exponent = rank
  from A's degree-n Cayley–Hamilton.
  Net: both flagships (the tower, degree=rank) reduced to one clean lemma each with n≤4 proved; the
  cohomological route closed. Open: Task 6 (genus-2 generality).
- **Comprehensive Paths A–F mandate (2026-06-05, Ledger V53–V59; suite 179 passed, 1 skip; proven
  core P1–P16 untouched).** Two prizes + a fully-labeled speculative tail:
  `frontier/B73_sl4_apoly/` (Path A, V54) the **degree=rank tower law** `Mⁿ=L` on the principal
  Dehn-filling component, confirmed at SL(4) (~1e-39);
  `frontier/B70_trace_ring/symbolic_m_pinv.py` (Path D, V55) the symbolic-m ε-series pinv-limit
  construction, reproducing the SL(3) tower from first principles;
  `frontier/physics_probes/spectral_curve_coulomb_test.py` (Path B, V53) confirms the j=1728 kill;
  `frontier/B74_higher_spin_grading/` (Path C, V56) the W_N parity grading = `−w0` of `A_{n−1}`
  (STRUCTURAL), spectrum diverges, dynamics SPECULATIVE-ANALOGY;
  `frontier/B75_metallic_degree_rank/` (Path F1, V57) the **m-axis** of degree=rank (odd metallic
  bundles m=1,3 give `M³=L`; convention-independent `eig[A,B]=eig(t)ⁿ`);
  `frontier/B76_cusp_quantum_group/` (Path F2/F3, V58) cusp k-set = SU(2)_{k−2} root-of-unity level
  set (closes B69), no categorical family lift (SPECULATIVE-ANALOGY);
  `frontier/B68_aj_conjecture/cyclotomic_numeric.py` (Path E, V59) confirms the V52 AJ bounded negative.
- **Open-paths sweep (2026-06-05, Ledger V43–V52).** `frontier/B71_sl3_apoly/` the SL(3) figure-eight
  A-variety (Fix(T_1²) = 3 components, matches Heusener–Muñoz–Porti / Falbel; `W1=D2→M³=L`,
  `W2=D3→M³L=1`); P1 Dehn-filling exact; P3 m=2 framing = m136; P4 rank-independent meridian; P5
  trace-ring scoping; P6 AJ bounded-negative.
- Full audit of all prior work: `AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `PROVENANCE.md`.
- Phase 0 governance scaffolding: `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CLAIMS.md`, `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`,
  `PROGRESS_LOG.md`, this changelog, `REPRODUCIBILITY.md`, `docs/ARCHIVE.md`, `.gitignore`.
- Claims ledger established: 10 `proven`, 4 `conditional`, 9 `open`, 10 `dead`.
- `legacy/` — prior history consolidated: curated text under `legacy/reports/`,
  `legacy/handoff/`, with the ~4 GB raw archive git-ignored under `legacy/raw/`.
- Phase A: the `origin_axiom` package (`src/`) and `tests/` suite locking every
  `proven` claim P1–P10 — 33 passing tests. Packaging via `pyproject.toml`.
- Session-3 integration: claims P11–P13 promoted to the proven core (exact-algebra
  results — sl(2) decomposition of `log A`, gluing-equation factorization,
  isospectrality), with tests (suite now 39 passing). Frontier probes B4
  (BKL/Gutzwiller) and B5 (Wheeler-DeWitt) added as logged observations.
- **Phase C kickoff** — `paths/` directory created: 25-path registry (20
  mathematizable E1–E20 across 11 mechanism classes; 5 philosophical P1–P5 in a
  separate register). The project's goal becomes *exhaustively surveying* the
  mechanisms by which "nothing being unstable" could produce reality, with the
  *map of attempted paths* as the deliverable. First batch selected: E14, E11, E5.
- **Session-3 synthesis** — the 2025 field-theory line reconnected to the algebraic
  skeleton. Claims **P15** (Möbius generating vector field `v(τ)=−κ(τ²−τ−1)`) and
  **P16** (derived potential `V(τ)=κ(τ³/3−τ²/2−τ)`) promoted to the proven core as
  exact algebra about A, with tests (`src/origin_axiom/mobius.py`,
  `tests/test_mobius_vector_field.py`, `tests/test_derived_potential.py`). Frontier
  probes **B6–B9** added (field equation, Fisher–KPP creation, particle spectrum
  with the non-exact `m/g≈φ` near-miss, fusion–scattering shared polynomial), each
  with caveats. Synthesis doc + scripts under `docs/SESSION3_SYNTHESIS.md` and
  `scripts/`. Four Oct-2025 genesis documents filed under `legacy/reports/genesis/`
  (historical only). Ledger: **15 `proven`**, 4 `conditional`, 9 `open`, 10 `dead`.
- Roadmap integration started with `docs/atlas/INTEGRATION_MANIFEST.md`, a
  public-safe manifest for migrating atlas, paper-candidate, campaign-synthesis,
  and review-packet material from private staging into the canonical repository.
- Research Atlas skeleton added under `docs/atlas/`: auditor guide, research
  tree, failure atlas, success atlas, glossary, and simulator ecosystem map. This
  is a navigation layer only; governed claims remain in `CLAIMS.md`.
- Paper-candidate registry added under `papers/`: candidate index, artifact
  manifest, and first paper cards for conditional uniqueness, noncommutative
  residue, and the quantum selector / state-integral bridge problem.
- Quantum selector campaign summarized under `docs/atlas/campaigns/`: public-safe
  synthesis of the 232-cycle run, preserving verdict counts, survivors, killed
  routes, stalled bridge classes, and theorem questions without raw run artifacts.
- PC02 validation packet added, giving readers a concise audit path for
  the conditional uniqueness theorem, its tests, caveats, and missing topology
  lemma.
- Noncommutative cancellation residue dossier added as an atlas node, with the
  PC04 paper card updated to point at canonical atlas evidence and the campaign
  synthesis.
- State-integral selector-gap dossier added as an atlas node, with the PC06 paper
  card updated to frame the route as an expertise-bound theorem question rather
  than a solved bridge.
- Atlas/paper integration roadmap closed through R7: manifest now marks R0-R6
  complete and records the final QA, merge, and tag gate for
  `atlas-paper-integration-v1`.
- Post-merge manifest cleanup: R7 marked complete after merge/tag, and stale
  closure wording removed. Existing `atlas-paper-integration-v1` tag left
  unchanged.
- PC02 paper-support lemma added: mapping-torus homology/torsion proof for the
  conditional uniqueness theorem, with PC02 paper card and review packet updated
  for external mathematical review.
- PC02 validation brief added, and PC02 readiness advanced from
  `EVIDENCE_EXISTS` to `NEEDS_VALIDATION` pending independent mathematical
  validation.
- Conditional uniqueness theorem formalized: `docs/UNIQUENESS_THEOREM.md` and
  `tests/test_uniqueness_theorem.py` lock the machine-checked algebra
  `A1-A7 -> A=LR` up to order, while keeping C1 conditional.
- Trace-map character-variety frontier campaign B13-B25 added. B18 establishes
  the canonical half-step trace lift; B22 kills the special parity narrative
  while preserving the special `A` quadratic sector; B25 records the Fibonacci
  spectrum at dimensionless `lambda/h=1` as a finite-approximant numerical
  anchor, initially classified as motivated, not derived. No claims promoted.
- Trace selector package added: B26-B47 refine the `lambda/h=1` selector, and
  `docs/TRACE_SELECTOR_THEOREM.md` formalizes conditional claim C5:
  `T1 -> S1 -> I=1/4 -> lambda/h=1`. The selector is conditional on T1, not
  proven or physical.
- PC11 validation packet added, plus `papers/REVIEWABILITY_INDEX.md` routing
  PC02 and PC11 through reviewability and falsifiability checks. PC11 readiness
  advances to `NEEDS_VALIDATION`, pending independent validation of T1.
- Reviewability/falsifiability workflow added: `papers/VALIDATION_WORKFLOW.md`,
  `papers/VALIDATION_LEDGER.md`, PC02 `REVIEWABILITY_CHECKLIST.md`, and
  validation briefs replace communication-oriented artifacts. No person-specific
  names or private correspondence are tracked in the repo.
- Falsifiability matrix added: `papers/FALSIFIABILITY_MATRIX.md` maps PC02,
  PC04, PC06, PC07, and PC11 to missing objects, validation questions, and
  kill/rescope conditions. PC07 now has a paper card, and public-surface hygiene
  is covered by `tests/test_public_surface_scan.py`.
- Metallic `SL(3)` trace-map intake added: B48 generalizes the B27 `m=1`
  Fibonacci trace lift to the family `a -> a^m b, b -> a`; PC12 now tracks the
  standalone arithmetic candidate with certificate-backed fixed-line controls.
  Raw side-work bundles remain private and are not copied into the repo.
- B49 proof-hardening added for PC12: the fixed-line splitting classification is
  decomposed into a universal splitting criterion, direct split families,
  square-gap propagation, finite strip exclusions, and negative boundary
  controls. PC12 remains `NEEDS_VALIDATION`.
- B50 proof-draft assembly added for PC12: B48/B49 are organized into an
  internal theorem-note skeleton with explicit theorem blocks, reproduction
  commands, non-claims, and draftability gates. PC12 remains `NEEDS_VALIDATION`.
- B51 symbolic-`m` proof module added for PC12: the `c=3` fixed-line Jacobian
  factorization is now verified with `m` formal, via closed-form derivative
  sequences and exchange block diagonalization.
- B52 multichannel Fibonacci bridge control added: the simplest three-channel
  tight-binding model gives `6x6` symplectic transfer matrices and fails the
  PC12 third-order `SL(3)` trace recursion, keeping PC12 mathematical.
- B53 literature screen completed for PC12 (`LITERATURE_POSITIONING.md`): the
  trace-map formula, commutator invariant, entropy, exchange decomposition, and
  symbolic factorization are `STANDARD_REPACKAGE` (Lawton; Baake-Grimm-Roberts;
  Bellon-Viallet); only the fixed-line splitting (Thm 4) is `APPARENTLY_NEW` and
  elementary. PC12 rescaled `THEOREM_NOTE` -> `COMPUTATIONAL_REPORT` (still
  `NEEDS_VALIDATION`).
- B54 general-`c` exchange structure added (`frontier/B54_general_c_exchange_structure/`):
  `[J(m,c),P]=0` proved for symbolic `c` (exchange block-diagonalization on the
  whole fixed line, generalizing B51), with the `c=1` Eisenstein/golden twin
  polynomials (disc -3, 5) echoing P12 and the `m=1` cyclotomic sweep.
- Phase-C path E21 added (`paths/E21_self_evidencing_closure/`): the
  self-evidencing / variational-free-energy framing of `lambda=m` is quarantined
  with verdict `STALLED` (structural analogy only; the exact fact is the single
  identity `4c^2-2=m^2+2`; predicts no observable). Kept out of PC12.
- PC02 draft note reconciled: the formal theorem-note structure (axiom table
  A1-A7, mapping-torus torsion lemma via the Wang sequence, the LR/RL
  based-invariant table, explicit theorem + proof) becomes the canonical
  `papers/candidates/PC02_conditional_uniqueness/DRAFT_NOTE.md`, replacing the
  earlier review-brief draft; the half-step / trace-map / conditional
  spectral-anchor material is retained as a clearly-marked non-theorem appendix.
  Editorial consolidation; PC02 stays `CONDITIONAL_THEOREM` / `NEEDS_VALIDATION`.
- B55 c=1 general-m structure added (`frontier/B55_c1_fixed_line_structure/`):
  the c=1 fixed-line symmetric sector is classified **mod 4** (`Φ₆` for m≡1,3;
  `Φ₄` for m≡2; degenerate `(t−1)²` for m≡0) and the antisymmetric sector is
  `(t−1)(t+1)(t²−mt−1) = char(M)` for all m, proved per residue class. Corrects
  the earlier odd/even reading and completes B54's c=1 row.
- B56 figure-eight invariant-surface negative control added
  (`frontier/B56_figure_eight_invariant_surface/`): the diagonal SL(2,C) reps
  have `I ∈ {4, −17/2 ± 7√5/2}`, none `= 1/4`; the figure-eight ↔ `I=1/4` bridge
  is `DEAD` and the c=1 Eisenstein resemblance is a cyclotomic coincidence. The
  P12 gluing-equation discriminant echo is unaffected.
- B57 general-m Diophantine splitting classification added
  (`frontier/B57_general_m_splitting/`): `{c=1, c=3}` are universal splitting
  points; m-dependent extras classified for m=1..6; the Hilbert-class-field
  coincidence (`h(−15)=2`) is killed for m≥2. Extends PC12's Theorem-4 content.
- E21 self-evidencing controls added (`paths/E21_self_evidencing_closure/`): two
  further session results, integrated as quarantine controls. (i) The Fisher
  information of `D(I)` equals `16/disc(char(M²)) = 16·g_WP(m²+2)` (a
  Goldman/Weil–Petersson coefficient) — exact but a chain-rule identity, geometric
  reading not promoted. (ii) Aubry self-duality at `λ=m` is dead (`λ=m` is the
  trivial fixed point of `λ→m²/λ`; no metal–insulator observable). Both strengthen
  E21's `STALLED` verdict; the Aubry kill is recorded in
  `docs/atlas/FAILURE_ATLAS.md`.
- SL(n) factor-count tower recorded as an **untested prediction** in PC12's
  `DRAFT_NOTE_SKELETON.md`: the rank-two `SL(n,C)` Jacobian is conjectured to
  factor into a parity block plus `(n²−1−parity)/2` degree-2 `char(M^k)` factors
  (confirmed n=2,3; SL(4)→7 untested). Not a claim; a candidate future probe.
- B58 SL(4) tower test added (`frontier/B58_sl4_tower_test/`): an attempt at the
  n=4 prediction. Confirms the mechanism (SL(4) identity recursion `(r-1)^4`,
  cubic derivative sequences) and the obstruction (the fixed-line point is the
  degenerate identity representation, so a representation-based numerical Jacobian
  cannot recover the ambient map). Verdict `NEEDS-EXPERTISE`; the 7-factor
  prediction stays untested. The full `15×15` ambient SL(4,C) trace map (Procesi
  generators + substitution action) is the required next build.
- B59 SL(4) fixed-line factorization added (`frontier/B59_sl4_factorization/`):
  resolves B58 numerically (method validated on SL(3) ground truth to ~4 digits).
  The SL(4) spectrum factors as
  `char(M^-1)char(M)char(M^2)char(M^3)char(M^4) · char(-M^2) · (t-1)^2(t+1)` —
  5 clean `char(M^k)` (k=-1..4), a sign sector, and a degree-3 parity block —
  **refuting** the naive `7 char(M^k) + parity` tower prediction. Numerical, not
  a symbolic proof; no claim promoted.
- B60 SL(n) tower added (`frontier/B60_sln_tower/`): generalizes B59's method and
  builds the corrected cross-n structure map. n=3: powers `{-1,2,3}`, parity
  deg 2; n=4: powers `{-1,1,2,3,4}` + `char(-M^2)` + parity deg 3 (powers climb,
  a sign sector appears, parity grows). **SL(5) unresolved** (`cond(Dx)~1e11`;
  needs a stable high-precision SVD solver or the symbolic ambient SL(5,C) trace
  ring). Numerical, method-validated for n=3,4; no claim promoted.
- B61 SL(5) high-precision factorization added (`frontier/B61_sl5_high_precision/`):
  ports the method to mpmath (dps 60) with a stable SVD pinv, and shows B60's
  "`cond(Dx)~1e11` wall" was a **rank-23** forward-only word set (the 24th
  singular value is the dps zero-floor, mis-read as `1e11` in double precision).
  Inverse-word coordinates (`A,B,A^-1,B^-1`) restore rank 24 at `cond~1e4`, and
  **22 of 24** SL(5) multipliers resolve to the catalog:
  `char(M^-1)·char(M)^2·char(M^2)·char(M^3)·char(M^4)·char(M^5)·char(-M^2)·char(-M^3)·(t-1)^2(t+1)^2`
  (powers climb to 5, sign sectors `-2,-3`, parity deg 4 -- the n=5 tower row).
  The last 2 modes are a **method limit** (fixed-line rank-loss makes the pinv
  `eps->0` limit gauge-dependent; residual scatters across seeds), needing the
  symbolic ambient SL(5,C) ring. SL(3)/SL(4) reproduce to ~4e-14/~3e-9.
  Numerical, high-precision; no claim promoted.
- PC12 made review-ready for an external specialist: a polished, self-contained
  `DRAFT_NOTE.md` (standard blocks Sec 2-5 with citations; the apparently-new
  fixed-line splitting classification in Sec 6; the numerical cross-n tower as a
  labeled Appendix A), plus `REVIEW_PACKET.md` (five sharpened questions) and
  `REVIEWABILITY_CHECKLIST.md`, mirroring PC02. A bounded literature refresh added
  the entropy=spectral-radius citation (arXiv:0812.0853) and found no prior art
  for the Sec-6 splitting or the cross-n tower. `PAPER_CARD` readiness advanced to
  `READY_FOR_REVIEW`; ledger row V12. No claim promoted.
- B62 opposition involution (`frontier/B62_opposition_involution/`): identifies
  B61's 2 unresolved SL(5) fixed-line modes. The B61 numerics cannot decide them
  (`tr(DT0)`/`det(DT0)` scatter across seeds). Identifying the exchange involution
  with the opposition involution `theta=-w0` on the `sl(n)` root system, its
  height-2 eigenspace split is exact and reproduces SL(3) (`char(M^2)`) and SL(4)
  (`char(M^2).char(-M^2)`); for SL(5) it is `char(M^2)^2.char(-M^2)`, so the 2
  unresolved modes are a second `char(M^2)` = {phi^2, 1/phi^2} (residual modes
  positive, corroborating). Completes the SL(5) tower row (22 numerical + 2
  structural). Recorded as a **live structural result**; a symbolic proof needs
  the ambient SL(5,C) trace ring. Ledger V13. No claim promoted.
- B63 SL(4) factorization over Z[m] (`frontier/B63_sl4_symbolic_m/`): establishes
  the metallic SL(4) fixed-line factorization for general `m` and proves
  m-independence. Building the symbolic Procesi trace ring (B58) is harder than
  "one level deeper" -- `e_2(A)` forces the 6-dim `Lambda^2` representation
  (depth-6) or multi-block words `tr((A^m B)^2 A)`; documented as the real reason
  B58 is hard. Instead, SL(4) being gauge-clean, the high-precision Jacobian is
  computed for `m=1..6`, each factor's eigenvalue sum extracted (= exact
  `tr(M^k)`) and interpolated in `m`:
  `char(M^-1)char(M)char(M^2)char(M^3)char(M^4)char(-M^2)(t-1)^2(t+1)` with
  `L_2=m^2+2, L_3=m^3+3m, L_4=m^4+4m^2+2`. The M-power/sign/parity structure is
  m-INDEPENDENT; m=1 reproduces B59. Computer-assisted symbolic (not a hand-built
  trace ring); the explicit `k(alpha)` root map is supplied by B62. Ledger V14.
  No claim promoted; proven core P1-P16 unchanged.
- B64 parity mechanism (`frontier/B64_parity_mechanism/`): proves the tower's
  `k(alpha)` sector-assignment formula as exact symbolic algebra. Depth-n
  Cayley-Hamilton makes the fixed-line Jacobian polynomial in `m`; `P` is the
  contragredient (`m -> -m`); Dickson parity `L_k(-m)=(-1)^k L_k(m)`. Hence
  **even-|k| `char(M^k)` sits in the P-symmetric sector, odd-|k| in the
  P-antisymmetric** (the root-height split B62 identified). Verified in full
  symbolic-`m` form for SL(3) (symmetric=(t-1)(t+1)char(M^2), antisym=
  char(M^-1)char(M^3)); applied to SL(4)'s factorization (even-k {M^2,M^4,-M^2}
  symmetric, odd-k {M^-1,M,M^3} antisymmetric). The depth-4 derivative sequences
  are built; a full symbolic SL(4) Jacobian's one remaining need is localized to
  `e_2 = tr(Lambda^2 A)` (the 6-dim exterior square, the even-k sector). Ledger
  V15. No claim promoted; proven core P1-P16 unchanged.
- B65 symbolic SL(4) Jacobian (`frontier/B65_sl4_symbolic_jacobian/`): determines
  the full 15x15 SL(4) fixed-line Jacobian `J(m)` exactly over `Z[m]` and factors
  `char(J(m))` directly as symbolic algebra. A hand-built trace ring needs
  multi-block reductions (rank check: single-block V+`Lambda^2` traces span only
  12/15), so instead the canonical (seed-independent) degree-4-in-m entries are
  reconstructed from high-precision numerics (SL(4) is gauge-clean) for `m=1..7`,
  over-determined (degree 4 fixed by 5 points, verified on 7); `sympy.factor`
  gives
  `char(J(m))=char(M^-1)char(M)char(M^2)char(M^3)char(M^4)char(-M^2)(t-1)^2(t+1)`.
  Matches B63/B64; `m=1` reproduces B59. The factorization is now *derived*
  (direct factoring of `J(m)`), not matched -- the strongest form short of a
  hand-derived Procesi trace ring (B58, still open). Computer-assisted entries +
  exact symbolic factorization. Ledger V16. No claim promoted; proven core
  P1-P16 unchanged.
- B66 SL(6) numerical tower (`frontier/B66_sl6_tower/`): computes the `n=6` row
  (35-dim) by the inverse-word method to settle the tower multiplicity formula.
  The opposition-involution theta-split sector dims (9 odd-height + 6 even-height
  + 5 parity = 35) are exact (the 9/6 is a root-height count, = |k|-parity only
  for odd n); the |k|=3 region resolves cleanly to exactly two quadratics
  (`char(M^3)`, `char(-M^3)`), so the **|k|=3 multiplicity = 2 — refuting
  `max(n-d,1)=3`** (SL(6) is the first `n` that distinguishes 3 from 2). Honest
  limit: 26/35 resolve, 9 modes gauge-corrupted (the B62 mechanism amplified from
  SL(5)'s 2 modes). Ledger V17. Numerical, no claim promoted; proven core P1-P16
  unchanged.
- B66 validation campaign (`frontier/B66_sl6_tower/{validate,second_m,gauge}.py`,
  `VALIDATION.md`; Ledger V19): stress-tested `mult(|k|=3) = 2` four ways. The
  identical inverse-word pipeline recovers SL(3..6) = 1,1,**2**,2 (SL(5)=2 under
  the same gauge-handling, auto-selected words); m=2 and m=3 give 2 with the |k|=3
  root tracking `L_3(m)`; the |k|=3 eigenvalues are seed-stable while the 8 gauge
  modes scatter (up to 3.8) across base points. Exact-over-Q is the honest
  negative -- the numerical Jacobian is non-canonical (`||dt0(20)-dt0(24)||~7e3`),
  so the from-first-principles exact route for n>=5 remains the trace ring (B58).
- B67 figure-eight A-polynomial from the trace map (`frontier/B67_figure_eight_apolynomial/`;
  Ledger V20): the metallic SL(2,C) trace map's fixed-point set (monodromy
  `phi=[[2,1],[1,1]]=M^2`, trace map `T_1^2`) reproduces the **published Cooper-Long
  (1996) figure-eight A-polynomial exactly** -- `A(M,L)=M^4L^2+(-M^8+M^6+2M^4+M^2-1)L+M^4`.
  A fiber rep extends over the bundle iff its character is `T_1^2`-fixed, so the fixed
  locus `y=z=x/(x-1)` is the A-polynomial curve; the monodromy `t` gives meridian
  `M=eig(t)`, longitude `L=eig[B,A]`, with trace identity `tr[A,B]=tr(t)^4-5tr(t)^2+2`.
  First derivation of this A-polynomial from a trace-map computation -- an independent
  cross-check of the SL(n) tower (B59-B66). SL(3) (Garoufalidis-Thurston-Zickert) is the
  open next step. No claim promoted; proven core P1-P16 unchanged.

### Fixed
- Tower verification pass (Ledger V18). **SL(2)/n=2 parity correction:** the
  `DRAFT_NOTE.md` cross-`n` tower table listed the `n=2` parity block as `none`,
  under-counting the 3-dimensional `SL(2)` variety; the identity-fixed-point
  Jacobian is `(t+1)·char(M^2)` for all `m` (parity eigenvalue = `det(M) = -1`),
  so the block is `(t+1)` — corrected. **B66 labeling:** the `sector_prediction`
  "9 odd-k + 6 even-k" is a root-HEIGHT count, equal to the `char(M^k)` |k|-parity
  count only for odd `n` (SL(4) is |k|-parity `(3,3)` but height `(4,2)`);
  relabeled "odd/even-height" throughout B66 + Ledger V17. The B66 `|k|=3 = 2`
  result (direct root-matching) is unaffected. Both facts, plus
  `char(-M^k)=char(M^{-k})` for odd `k` only and `L_k(-m)=(-1)^k L_k(m)` through
  `L_8`, are now locked in `tests/test_b66_sl6_tower.py`.
- **CORRECTED MISCONCEPTION (B58 Stage 1, Ledger V21).** The scoping guesses that
  the cotangent dimension is `3n^2-10n+11` (=8,19,36) and the excess `2(n-2)(n-3)`
  (=0,4,12) were **never validated and are REFUTED** by the Đoković cross-check.
  Kept visible (not deleted) so they are never re-derived. Actual cotangent (d-sigma
  on `m/m^2` of the two-traceless-matrix trace algebra, modular over F_p, prime-stable):
  `9` (n=3, = Teranishi 11 GL gens − 2) and `30` (n=4, = Đoković, exact per-degree
  distribution), `>= 111` (n=5, PARTIAL lower bound). Actual excess (cotangent − the
  `n^2-1` Jacobian) = `1, 15, >= 87` — a large mixed Dickson+parity multiset, the
  *secondary* trace invariants (n=3: `det[X,Y]`). This **closes the cotangent route to
  the `a_d` multiplicities** (see FAILURE_ATLAS); `a_d` needs the exterior-power
  Cayley-Hamilton hand proof. (arXiv 2603.00816 Ishibashi-Mizuno confirmed real by
  independent search; Kozai 1509.07487 and 2411.04431 pre-2026, fetched.)
  *Forward guard:* no entropy/"spectral-weight" probe was produced; if one is ever
  added, note that it computes `Σ|k|` spectral weight, NOT topological entropy
  (= `n·log μ`, linear) — no `n^2` scaling, no fixed "antisymmetric fraction".

### Added
- B58 Stage 1 (`frontier/B58_stage1/`): the modular-F_p cotangent computation and the
  Sym^{2k}/Kostant diagnostic (Step 2: bare = even-only/overshoot, coupled = odd-only,
  neither = tower — B64's parity split is a sorting, not a formula). Tests in
  `tests/test_b58_stage1.py`.
- Overnight exploratory queue (`frontier/overnight_2026-06-03/`, Ledger V22/V23):
  Job 1 time-reversal = Jacobian-level Dickson parity (corollary); Job 4 SL(7) partial
  (constraints, char(M^3)=a_3=1 at n=7, INCONCLUSIVE); Job 2 SL(3) A-poly Sym^2 NO-GO
  (geometric component is boundary-unipotent/GTZ); Job 3 cross-m m=2 = census m136,
  framing OPEN; Job 5 skipped (gate). Job 6 AJ (`frontier/B68_aj_conjecture/`,
  `frontier/aj_conjecture_check.json`): shelved, NOT promoted (order-2 recursion match
  is below B67's exact-identity bar; q=1 limit unresolved). Literature review in
  `frontier/literature_search.md` (principal-SL(2) / adjoint-torsion / Kozai framing).
- B58 Phase A (`frontier/B58_phaseA/`, Ledger V24–V26): an EXACT `(n^2-1)` fixed-line Jacobian
  engine (`jacobian_closure.py`; eps-series dual numbers over F_p; the least-squares form of
  B66's pinv limit). VALIDATED at n=4 — reproduces B65's `a_d=(1,1,1,1)` exactly, prime-stable.
- Candidate general-`n` `a_d` formula recorded (`frontier/B58_phaseA/CANDIDATE_A_D.md`): the
  opposition-involution θ-split, `a_h=⌈(n-h)/2⌉`, `b_h=⌊(n-h)/2⌋` for `h=2..n-1`, plus an
  OBSERVED height-1/wrap piece (`char(M^1)^{n-3}·char(M^-1)·char(M^n)`) and parity. Reproduces
  the n=3,4,5 towers EXACTLY (integer-valid + dimension-sum `=n^2-1`, n=3..7). **CONJECTURED —
  unproven (needs the trace-ring identification, B58) and incomplete (height-1/wrap observed).**
- B62 proof status clarified (`frontier/B58_phaseA/B62_STATUS.md`): State 3 for the full `a_d`,
  State 2 (verified candidate) for height-2 only; θ-eigenspace dims are exact Lie theory, the
  identification with the Jacobian is unproven.
- **Phase-8 physics-paths sweep (`frontier/physics_probes/`, Ledger V28–V39): robustly negative.**
  A systematic probe of every reachable physics anchor. Headline: real mathematics, **no crossing
  into fundamental or new-quantum physics** — every anchor is special to `n=2`/`m=1`. Metallic
  anyons (V28, closed: categorifiable only at `m=1`, Ostrik rank-2) and SL(n) quasicrystal spectra
  (V29, closed: the symplectic obstruction, `SL(n)=Sp` only at `n=2`) both negative; Chern–Simons
  torsion family (V30, no pattern) with `τ_m` identified as **Porti's adjoint Reidemeister torsion
  form** (V31). The `m136`/`m=2` A-polynomial framing is **RESOLVED** — the m=2 trace-map eliminant
  `M²L²−(M⁴−4M²+1)L+M²` IS census-m136, confirmed by holonomy-match (V32) and an independent
  from-scratch null-space-dim-1 fit (V38). Consolidated in `PHYSICS_PROBES_SUMMARY.md`.
- B69 metallic A-polynomial family + cusp-torsion law (`frontier/B69_metallic_apoly_family/`, Ledger
  V35/V39/V40): VERIFIED m=1..4; cusps at elliptic-torsion `x=2cos(π/k)`. **Novelty: STANDARD_REPACKAGE**
  — the cusp law is the known Baker–Petersen once-punctured-torus-bundle ideal-point structure
  (arXiv:1211.4479), not new.
- B70 trace-ring attack on `a_d` (`frontier/B70_trace_ring/`, Ledger V41/V42): the SL(n) two-block /
  `e₂=tr(Λ²A)` obstruction is **rank-1 at leading order** (pinned exactly to `e₂`; verified SL(4),SL(5)
  on the traceless `sl(n)` tangent), and its full closure is a **bounded, finite multi-generator** set
  (bidegree `≤(3,3)` by `c=n` nilpotency). The two-block barrier is now a precise finite structure —
  computer-assisted characterization, **not PROVEN**. The `SL(3)` GTZ A-polynomial (Track B) is the
  deferred more-tractable follow-on.

### Changed
- **REFUTED (kept visible as honest history): the exact-`Q` "field fix" hypothesis for the n=5
  `a_2` shortfall.** The shortfall is the pinv-limit CONSTRUCTION, not the field/metric — three
  realizations (F_p random metric; F_p `S=I`, prime-stable `= Q` mod `p`; real positive-definite
  mpmath) all return `a_2=1` where the truth is `2`. The `eps->0` least-squares limit is
  non-canonical at the degenerate `char(M^2)^2/(t+1)^2` collision (defective non-Dickson cubic).
  So the pinv / ambient-Jacobian route (B59–B66 + the Phase A engine) **under-counts degenerate
  multiplicities** — *wrong* from n=5, not merely ceilinged at n=6 (FAILURE_ATLAS, sharpened).
- `b_d=[d<=n-2]` DOWNGRADED: an n<=5 match only — it diverges from the θ-split at n=6 (`b_2`:
  1 vs 2). OPEN for n>=6.
- `a_3(n=6)` is now OPEN (Ledger V17 annotated): B66's numerical `1` is understood as the pinv
  under-count at a degenerate collision; the θ-split candidate predicts `2` (better-supported,
  not asserted).
- Strategic state: the pinv / ambient-Jacobian route is EXHAUSTED as a path to *degenerate*
  `a_d`; the B58 trace ring (structural form + identification proof) is the sole remaining route
  that both computes and proves it. The fork — bank the candidate + finding as a written result
  vs commit to the multi-session B58 trace-ring proof — is DEFERRED (human decision).

### Changed
- Project framing locked to the disciplined V4 / Reality-Check line; the optimistic
  `handoff.md` framing demoted to historical record.

### Notes
- This repository consolidates four prior GitHub repositories and the May-2026 session
