\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
The Origin Axiom enforces non-zero global amplitude with selective interventions (27--749 activations), minimal energy cost, and no backreaction—robust across all regimes, linking philosophical puzzles to physical vacuum dynamics.

Intellectually, it connects Leibniz's query to QFT vacuum stability \citep{Padmanabhan2003}, offering a dynamical alternative to anthropic selection \citep{Susskind2003}.

Limitations: Toy model; finite lattice/no renormalization; no full GR/SM coupling. No quantitative $\Lambda$ match—residual too small for plateau at current scales, requiring larger simulations.

Future: Ultra-low `\(\epsilon\)` ($10^{-5+}$), larger `\(N\)`, `\(\theta^\star\)`-tuning for `\(\rho\)` plateau; multi-field extensions.

The axiom provides a novel mechanism ensuring ``something rather than nothing'' in cosmology. Full code/logs at \url{github.com/originaxiom/origin-axiom}.
