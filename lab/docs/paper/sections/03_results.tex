\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We present the results of the Origin Axiom framework systematically, following the chain from flavor phenomenology to microstructure. All simulations are reproducible via git-tagged versions in the repositories \url{https://github.com/originaxiom/origin-axiom} and \url{https://github.com/originaxiom/origin-axiom-theta-star}.

\subsection{Flavor Bridge}
The $\thetastar$-modulated seesaw mechanism reproduces realistic neutrino masses. At fiducial $\thetastar = 3.63$ rad, the heaviest mass $m_3 \sim 0.05$ eV and atmospheric splitting $\Delta m^2_\text{atm} \sim 2.93 \times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ match PDG values within the suppression factor $M_\text{scale} \approx 2.64 \times 10^{-6}$. The axiom enforces a non-zero sum $\sum m_\nu > \epsilon \sim 10^{-12}$ eV, preventing zero-mass cancellation and ensuring hierarchical structure consistent with observed mixing. This bridge links empirical flavor data to scalar vacuum dynamics.

\subsection{Vacuum Energy Modulation}
In microcavity simulations (ScalarToyUniverse on a 32$^3$ lattice), the effective mass $m_\text{eff} = m_3(\thetastar)$ induces a vacuum energy shift $\Delta E(\thetastar)$ with $\sim$2.2\% relative modulation (range $1.1648821444176088 \times 10^{-5}$ to $1.1900196411864655 \times 10^{-5}$ energy units). The axiom stabilizes the global amplitude $|A| \sim 0.01$ with $\sim$125,000 constraint hits per run of 500 steps. This modulation demonstrates how flavor influences vacuum energy, a key step toward cosmological implications.

\subsection{Cosmological Expansion}
Interpolating $\Delta E(\thetastar)$ as effective $\Lambda(\thetastar)$ in FRW evolution (5000 steps), the seesaw modulation accelerates the final scale factor $a_\text{final}$ by $\sim$1.0\% (from 13.75 to 13.89). M_scale sweeps reveal up to 38\% acceleration at low scales (stronger $\Lambda$), confirming flavor-cosmology linkage. The axiom maintains field stability throughout, preventing deep cancellations during expansion. This step demonstrates how flavor-induced vacuum shifts can mimic observed dark energy effects, with the modulation propagating from the flavor bridge (Section \ref{sec:flavor}).

\subsection{Microstructure}
In 3D lattices (32$^3$) with Gaussian defects (n=1–10), seesaw-modulated mass stabilizes particle-like structures. The final global amplitude $|A|$ oscillates $\pm$1.5 at low defect counts, damping with more defects (volume averaging). Vacuum shift $\Delta E \sim -0.00001$ to $-0.00002$, with 3D mid-slice visualizations confirming persistent defect cores. The axiom enforces stability with $\sim$125,000 hits per run, suggesting defects as potential dark matter candidates. This argues for microstructure as a bridge to dark sector physics, building on the vacuum modulation from Section \ref{sec:vacuum}.

\subsection{Full Unification Chain}
The synthesis script chains all phases, yielding end-to-end modulation $\sim$0.7\% (Fig. \ref{fig:unified}). Aligned peaks/dips across scales demonstrate consistent $\thetastar$-dependence, with the axiom stabilizing dynamics from flavor to microstructure. This step confirms the axiom's unifying power, with emergent implications for dark energy and matter, arguing for a flavor-origin cosmology grounded in the axiom's principle.
