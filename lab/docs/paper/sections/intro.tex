\section{Introduction}
The question ``why is there something rather than nothing?''—posed by Leibniz and central to cosmology—challenges why the universe has positive energy rather than absolute vacuum. In QFT, destructive interference permits local cancellations, and global nothingness is not forbidden, yet observations show a small positive cosmological constant $\Lambda \approx \SI{10^{-52}}{\meter^{-2}}$ \citep{Padmanabhan2003, Bianchi2010}.

We propose the \textbf{Origin Axiom}: a dynamical rule ensuring the global amplitude $|A| = |\sum \phi| > 0$ for a complex scalar field $\phi$, structurally prohibiting perfect cancellation. Motivated by philosophical incoherence of nothingness and inspired by vacuum selection in string landscapes \citep{Susskind2003}, the axiom is tested in progressive 3D lattice models: static coherent/disordered states, parameter scaling, FRW expansion, and nonlinear interactions. Results show selective enforcement with negligible cost, qualitatively protecting non-zero vacuum against dephasing and dilution.
