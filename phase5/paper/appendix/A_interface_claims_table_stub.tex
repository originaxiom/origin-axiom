\section{Interface Claims Table (Stub)}
\label{app:claims-table}

This appendix is reserved for a simple claims table once Phase 5 has
well-defined, program-level claims of its own (for example, statements
about completeness of the interface, or guarantees about how upstream
artifacts are exposed).

At the current skeleton stage, Phase 5 makes no new physical claims.
Consequently, this appendix is intentionally left as a placeholder.
