\section{Preamble}

Phase 5 is designed as a program-level interface and dashboard phase for
the Origin-Axiom project. In contrast to Phases 0--4, which each carry
their own technical scopes and claims, Phase 5 is intentionally
\emph{derivative}: it consumes already-locked outputs and exposes them in
a structured, inspectable way for future synthesis and comparison.

This document is a Rung 0--1 skeleton. It focuses on:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item pinning down the scope and non-claims of Phase 5,
  \item documenting the interface contract between Phase 5 and the
        Phase 3/4 outputs that have already been generated, and
  \item outlining how these ingredients can later be turned into a
        program-level dashboard and meta-analysis layer.
\end{itemize}

No new physical hypotheses are introduced here. The goal is to make the
existing machinery as transparent, reproducible, and extensible as
possible.
