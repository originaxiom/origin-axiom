\section{Towards a Viability Dashboard (Stub)}
\label{sec:dashboard}

The long-term objective of Phase 5 is to provide a program-level
\emph{viability dashboard} that pulls together:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item mechanical binding and instability diagnostics from Phase 3,
  \item mapping and FRW toy/probe diagnostics from Phase 4, and
  \item (optionally) external cosmological distance data, when available
        and appropriately documented.
\end{itemize}

At this Rung--0/1 stage, the dashboard is intentionally minimal:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item The interface script verifies that all required inputs are
        present and logs their sizes.
  \item The summary JSON provides a clear, machine-readable snapshot of
        the repository state.
  \item No aggregation, scoring, or visualization is yet implemented in
        the public code or this document.
\end{enumerate}

Future rungs are expected to:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item define explicit, phase-aligned metrics for ``viability'' and
        ``failure modes'',
  \item construct compact tables or figures that summarize these metrics
        without re-fitting or rewriting upstream results, and
  \item attach any external data used for comparison with clear
        provenance and reproducibility contracts.
\end{itemize}

This section is therefore a placeholder: it records intent and boundary
conditions without overstating what currently exists.
