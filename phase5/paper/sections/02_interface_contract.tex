\section{Interface Contract}
\label{sec:interface}

The core of Phase 5 is an explicit, machine-readable contract describing
which upstream artifacts it consumes and how they are organized. This
contract is encoded in the JSON file
\texttt{phase5/config/phase5\_inputs\_v1.json} and enforced by the
Python interface script
\texttt{phase5/src/phase5/phase5\_interface\_v1.py}.

\subsection{Configuration}

The configuration file enumerates three logical groups:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Phase 3 block:} references to the mechanical baseline
        diagnostics and measure statistics, such as
        \texttt{phase3/outputs/tables/mech\_baseline\_scan\_diagnostics.json},
        \texttt{phase3/outputs/tables/phase3\_measure\_v1\_stats.json},
        \texttt{phase3/outputs/tables/phase3\_measure\_v1\_hist.csv},
        and
        \texttt{phase3/outputs/tables/phase3\_instability\_penalty\_v1.json}.
  \item \textbf{Phase 4 block:} references to the F1 mapping diagnostics
        and FRW toy/probe outputs, including the F1 sanity and shape
        diagnostics and the various FRW viability, LCDM, shape, and data
        probes and their masks.
  \item \textbf{External block:} an optional entry for a binned FRW
        distance dataset,
        \texttt{phase4/data/external/frw\_distance\_binned.csv}, which
        may or may not be present in a given copy of the repository.
\end{itemize}

The configuration does not alter these paths; it records them so the
interface can systematically check their presence.

\subsection{Diagnostics Summary}

Running the interface script produces a summary JSON file:
\begin{center}
\texttt{phase5/outputs/tables/phase5\_interface\_v1\_summary.json}
\end{center}
which reports, for each configured path:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item the absolute and relative path,
  \item whether the file exists,
  \item its size in bytes (if present), and
  \item any additional notes for non-path entries (such as the
        external-data description).
\end{itemize}

In particular, the current summary explicitly confirms that all
Phase 3 and Phase 4 inputs required by the configuration are present,
and that the external FRW distance file is missing but treated as
optional. This is not a physical statement about the data; it is a
documentation of the repository state and the robustness requirements
imposed on Phase 5.
