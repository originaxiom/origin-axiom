# Phase 5 Vision (Rung 0 – Planning Document)

**Status:** Rung 0 (vision only; no binding claims)  
**Scope:** Define the conceptual role of Phase 5 and chart candidate routes
toward a physically motivated non-cancellation mechanism.

This document is intentionally **non-binding**.  It does *not* introduce
new claims, mechanisms, or parameter identifications.  Instead, it
articulates what Phase 5 is *for* and how it will interface with the
Phase 0–4 infrastructure once the lower phases have climbed to higher
rungs.

## 1. Role of Phase 5 in the program

Phases 0–4 are deliberately conservative:

- Phase 0 defines the corridor method and ledger but does not fix a
  preferred value of \(\theta\) or a physical scale.
- Phase 1 constructs and stress-tests a non-cancellation axiom in a
  deliberately abstract setting.
- Phase 2 explores early attempts to connect the axiom to more
  structured toy universes and archives negative or superseded
  directions.
- Phase 3 builds a concrete ensemble-based mechanism, demonstrating
  that a non-trivial floor can be enforced without trivialising the
  dynamics.
- Phase 4 wraps the Phase 3 output in FRW-facing diagnostics and
  corridor-style probes, while keeping all cosmology-facing claims
  strictly non-binding.

**Phase 5 is where the program is allowed to ask a harder question:**

> *Can the non-cancellation axiom, or any concrete mechanism derived
>  from it, be embedded into a physically meaningful framework that
>  goes beyond toy models–for example, by connecting to field theory,
>  cosmology, or hierarchy- and scale-generating mechanisms?*

Phase 5 is *not* obligated to succeed at this.  Its initial goal is to
organise the space of possibilities in a way that is compatible with
the reproducibility and epistemic discipline of the earlier phases.

## 2. Inputs from Phases 0–4

By the time Phase 5 becomes active at higher rungs, it is expected to
take as input:

- **From Phase 0:**
  - A corridor ledger describing which mechanisms, filters, and
    diagnostics exist, and which (if any) have progressed to binding
    corridor constraints.
  - A clear distinction between exploratory diagnostics and binding
    filters.

- **From Phase 1:**
  - A precise formulation of the non-cancellation axiom, including its
    domain of applicability and known consistency checks.
  - Any archived negative results or modified axiom variants.

- **From Phase 2:**
  - A curated set of early toy universes or constructions that are
    still conceptually relevant, even if they are not used directly in
    Phase 3 and 4.

- **From Phase 3 (Mechanism A and successors):**
  - Ensemble-based constructions where a floor \(\varepsilon\) is
    imposed at the level of an amplitude-like observable \(A(\theta)\).
  - Stability and measure diagnostics (e.g., baseline scans,
    distribution probes, and instability-penalty metrics) that
    quantify how “costly” it is for the ensemble to support a given
    floor.
  - Well-documented negative or ambiguous results: situations where
    floors lead to pathologies, trivialisation, or inconsistency.

- **From Phase 4:**
  - FRW-inspired mapping families that turn Phase 3 output into
    cosmology-facing quantities \((E_{\mathrm{vac}}(\theta), H^2(a;
    \theta), \Omega_\Lambda(\theta), \dots)\) in a transparent but
    explicitly toy manner.
  - Diagnostic corridors and probe masks (shape, FRW viability,
    \(\Lambda\)CDM-like subsets, data stubs) that can, in principle,
    be tightened or discarded once more realistic structures are
    introduced.

Phase 5 does *not* need all of these to be final; it only requires
that the interfaces be stable enough to support interpretation and
experimentation with more physically motivated mechanisms.

## 3. Central questions for Phase 5

Phase 5 is intended to organise work around the following families of
questions:

1. **Origin of the floor:**
   - Can a bound like \(|A| \ge \varepsilon\) arise from:
     - topological or index-theorem-like constraints?
     - consistency conditions on quantum states (e.g. avoidance of
       certain singularities or pathologies)?
     - measure-theoretic or entropy-based arguments in a larger
       ensemble of histories or vacua?
   - What are the minimal assumptions under which a non-zero floor is
     forced, rather than chosen?

2. **Scale of the floor:**
   - Are there mechanisms that naturally generate hierarchies of
     scales, one of which could plausibly be associated with an
     effective vacuum-energy scale?
   - Can the Phase 3 instability diagnostics be repurposed as a
     “cost” function that favours certain ranges of \(\varepsilon\),
     without overclaiming?

3. **Embedding into structured theories:**
   - Which classes of structured models are most promising targets?
     - Simple scalar-field models with potentials constrained by the
       axiom.
     - Multi-sector or hidden-sector constructions where a floor in
       one sector induces constraints elsewhere.
     - Toy models inspired by known QFT or cosmology but treated at a
       deliberately schematic level.
   - How can we keep these models honest about what they do *not*
     capture?

4. **Feedback to corridors and filters:**
   - Under what conditions could a Phase 5 mechanism suggest a
     genuine \(\theta\)-filter (even if only at the level of a
     diagnostic corridor in Phase 0)?
   - How can such proposals be expressed in terms of the existing
     tables, masks, and summary statistics, so that they are
     independently checkable?

## 4. Candidate work packages (non-binding)

The following are **candidate** work packages for future Phase 5
rungs.  They are described here to provide direction, but they may be
re-scoped or discarded as evidence accumulates.

### WP5.A – Topological / consistency-motivated floors (exploratory)

- Explore toy models in which certain classes of states are forbidden
  by a topological, anomaly, or consistency argument, and examine
  whether the resulting allowed states exhibit an effective
  non-cancellation floor.
- Interface with Phase 3 diagnostics by asking whether ensembles that
  respect the constraint occupy characteristic regions in the
  \((\varepsilon, \mathrm{penalty})\) space.

### WP5.B – Measure- and entropy-based selection

- Treat the Phase 3 ensembles as approximations to a larger space of
  histories or vacua and ask how different measures over this space
  weight low-\(|A|\) configurations.
- Investigate whether simple entropy or typicality arguments can
  produce an *effective* non-zero floor, even if the underlying
  theory does not impose a sharp bound.

### WP5.C – Scale hierarchies and effective vacuum energy

- Develop toy constructions in which the non-cancellation mechanism
  participates in generating hierarchies of scales, rather than
  directly fixing a physical value.
- Use the Phase 4 FRW-facing diagnostics only as sanity checks (e.g.,
  “does this mechanism admit trajectories with late-time acceleration
  and a long matter era?”) without over-identifying any specific
  parameter choice with our universe.

### WP5.D – Back-reaction on Phase 0 corridors

- For any candidate mechanism that survives early tests, define:
  - which \(\theta\)-regions it disfavors or excludes;
  - how this information could be encoded as *proposed* updates to
    the Phase 0 corridor ledger.
- Keep these proposals in a clearly marked, non-binding section until
  there is enough supporting evidence to justify a Phase 0 rung
  update.

## 5. Non-claims and discipline

At this vision rung, Phase 5 explicitly:

- **does not** claim to derive the observed value of the cosmological
  constant;
- **does not** identify any specific \(\theta^\star\) with our
  universe;
- **does not** promote any particular mapping or mechanism to a
  binding filter in Phase 0;
- **does** commit to:
  - documenting all assumptions and toy-model steps with the same
    reproducibility standards as Phases 0–4;
  - archiving negative or ambiguous results as first-class citizens of
    the program;
  - maintaining a strict separation between what is structurally
    suggestive and what is empirically or theoretically warranted.

The immediate next step for Phase 5 is therefore *not* to build a
large new apparatus, but to serve as a **well-defined receptor** for
mechanism ideas that emerge as Phases 3 and 4 climb to higher rungs.
