# Phase 5 – Non-Claims

This document lists statements that Phase 5 **does not** claim at the
current stage (Rung 0–1). It is a guardrail against over-interpretation.

---

## 1. No new fundamental physics mechanism

Phase 5 does **not** introduce:

- A new microscopic model of vacuum instability,
- A new θ-field, mapping family, or mechanism A/B/C,
- Any modification to the core non-cancellation axiom.

All mechanism work lives in earlier phases (especially Phase 3 and
Phase 4). Phase 5 only consumes their outputs.

---

## 2. No cosmological parameter inference yet

Phase 5, at its current rung, does **not**:

- Infer or publish best-fit values for:
  - \(H_0\),
  - \(\Omega_\Lambda\),
  - \(\Omega_m\),
  - or any other cosmological density parameters.

- Claim to:
  - Resolve the Hubble tension,
  - Resolve the \(S_8\) tension,
  - Provide a definitive alternative to \(\Lambda\)CDM.

Any use of synthetic FRW probes in Phase 4 is still **pipeline-level
experimentation**, not a final cosmological fit.

---

## 3. No claim about the true value of \(\Lambda\)

Even though the overall program is motivated by connecting the axiom to
vacuum energy and the cosmological constant, Phase 5 (Rung 0–1) makes no
claim of the form:

> “The true cosmological constant of our universe is X.”

Phase 5 may help define **how such a claim could eventually be tested**,
but it does not assert the claim itself at this stage.

---

## 4. No guarantee of empirical adequacy

Phase 5 does **not** yet assert that:

- The current mapping family F1,
- The specific implementation of FRW probes in Phase 4,
- Or the current vacuum mechanism diagnostics in Phase 3,

are empirically adequate models of our universe.

Phase 5 treats these as **structured hypotheses and pipelines**, not as
validated descriptions of reality.

---

## 5. No socio-technical or governance claims

Phase 5 does **not**:

- Claim that the Origin Axiom framework should govern institutions,
- Claim any immediate policy, economic, or ethical consequences.

Those discussions belong to future, explicitly labeled layers (beyond
scientific Phases 0–5), and must not be inferred from Phase 5 Rung 0–1.

---

## 6. No “inevitability” narrative

Phase 5 does not claim that:

- The program is guaranteed to succeed,
- The axiom inevitably explains all aspects of physics,
- There is no room for alternative mechanisms or competing theories.

Phase 5 Rung 0–1 is about **clear interfaces and honest framing**, not
destiny or inevitability.
