# Phase 5 documentation layout (Stage 2 snapshot)

Status (2026-01-11): This note classifies Phase 5 Markdown docs into canonical contracts, design and planning notes, and historical or audit material. It does not change any claims.

## 1. Canonical contracts

These files define Phase 5 as an interface and viability-dashboard layer over Phases 3–4 and Stage 2 diagnostics:

- `phase5/SCOPE.md` — Phase 5 scope.
- `phase5/NON_CLAIMS.md` — explicit non-claims and guardrails for Phase 5.
- `phase5/ROLE_IN_PROGRAM.md` — Phase 5 role in the overall program.
- `phase5/PHASE5_ALIGNMENT_v1.md` — alignment memo linking Phase 5 docs, interface plans, and global docs.
- `phase5/PHASE5_VISION_RUNG0.md` — Phase 5 vision at Rung 0 (interface and dashboard behavior).
- `phase5/INTERFACE_TABLE_DESIGN_v1.md` — design of Phase 5 interface tables that encode the Stage 2 verdicts.
- `phase5/PROGRAM_VERDICT_SKELETON_v1.md` — Phase 5 internal program-verdict skeleton, restating the Stage 2 master verdict in Phase 5 voice.
- `phase5/PROGRESS_LOG.md` — Phase 5 progress log.

These files are the binding description of what Phase 5 is and how it consumes Stage 2 outputs.

## 2. Design and planning notes

Design and planning notes for Phase 5 include:

- Any additional design documents under `phase5/` (if added later) that refine the dashboard layout, future metrics, or potential Stage II extensions, provided they are marked as vision, planning, or draft.

These documents are allowed to explore future interface and governance ideas without changing the canonical Phase 5 contracts until those changes are explicitly adopted.

## 3. Historical or audit material

At the current snapshot Phase 5 has little historical or archived material. As interface code and dashboards are implemented, any significant redesigns or superseded concepts can be recorded as:

- archived design notes, or
- dedicated audit summaries for Phase 5 interface behavior.

These should be logged in `phase5/PROGRESS_LOG.md` when they occur.
