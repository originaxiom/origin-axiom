Experiment: Random-phase ensemble with vs without non-cancelling constraint.

Goal:
    - Generate many random-phase initial states.
    - Evolve with and without the constraint.
    - Compare distributions:
        * mode amplitudes,
        * spatial correlations,
        * time-averaged observables.

Outputs go to:
    data/processed/cancellation_system/random_phases/
