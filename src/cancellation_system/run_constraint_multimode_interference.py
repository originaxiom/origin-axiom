Experiment: Multimode interference and near-cancellation under constraint.

Goal:
    - Construct initial conditions designed for destructive interference
      among several modes.
    - Compare evolution with vs without non-cancelling constraint.
    - Look for:
        * suppression or destabilization of exact cancellation patterns,
        * qualitative differences in late-time field configurations.

Outputs go to:
    data/processed/cancellation_system/multimode_interference/
