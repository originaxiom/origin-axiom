# Origin Axiom

**Short idea:**  
Reality exists because *absolute nothingness is impossible* and it is kept from ever cancelling back to "0" by a fundamental, non-cancelling phase twist **θ\*** encoded in a scalar backbone. This repo contains the formal statement of the axiom, the research program built around it, and the first toy-universe models and code.

## Structure

- `docs/`
  - Conceptual documents:
    - `01_origin_axiom.md` – the axiom (Non-Cancelling Existence)
    - `02_research_program.md` – the Origin Axiom research program
    - `03_toy_universe_v0_1.md` – definition of Toy Universe v0.1
- `paper/`
  - LaTeX sources for the main research paper(s).
- `src/`
  - Source code for toy models and simulations.
  - `toy_universe_lattice/` – 3D lattice scalar model implementing the axiom.
- `notebooks/`
  - Jupyter notebooks for exploration, plots, and experiments.
- `data/`
  - `raw/` – raw simulation output (not tracked by git).
  - `processed/` – reduced/aggregated data for figures.

## Concept in one line

> **Origin Axiom:**  
> Reality is forced into existence because absolute nothingness is not a coherent possibility, and a fundamental non-cancelling phase twist **θ\*** forbids the universe from ever reaching a perfectly cancelling state. A single scalar field Φ, living on a simple microstructure, carries this twist and organizes everything else.

## Status

- Axiom and research program: **drafted** (see `docs/`).
- Toy Universe v0.1 (3D cubic lattice scalar): **specified**, implementation WIP.
- This repo is currently pre-publication, used to organize and track the development of the Origin Axiom as a serious, falsifiable research program.
